I will be using the EliteProspects scouting guide to perform NLP Topic Modelling on the NHL draft.

# Scouting Reports and Topic Modelling

A frequent topic of debate in the scouting world is the debate between prospect production vs scouting analysis.  It's typically the case that high producing players eventually find their way to the NHL, but not enough for it to become a rule for scouts to lean on when an evaluation becomes tough.

The art of scouting is one of video analysis, skills assessment, and projection.  Much of what a scout does is hard, if not impossible to catch solely with production data.  And while there is a growing push for draft picks to be assessed purely on statistical profiles, there still remains far too many high production players that see a drop off in their abilities as they move to the next level.

This project is an undertaking in bridging the gap between the scouting community's analysis and the prospect modelling community by integrating the reports of the scouts via NLP topic modelling into a broader overall analysis of the drafted players.

My hypothesis is that scouts will speak similarly of players who show similar projections, or who play the game in a similar way or have similar weaknesses.  Topic modelling would catch these assessments and find any natural clustering of player archetypes the scouts may intentionally or unintentionally be conveying in their broader reports on the players.  My hope is that by finding any natural clusters in the reports, we will be able to utilize the "topics" these players find themselves in, in a more thorough research report. A report that might include finding which particular skills are weighted too heavily, which skills aren't appreciated enough, and what kind of players find themselves out-performing either their sub-par draft production or a sub-par viewing from the broader scouting community.
