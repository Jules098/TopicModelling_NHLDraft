Alexis Lafreniere,"You've doubtless heard Alexis Lafreniere's name roll off the tip of every scout and hockey analyst's tongue at one point or another for nearly half a decade. He's that type of talent. This season was hardly the last step of a saunter from Saint-Eustache, Quebec to the top spot on the 2020 NHL Draft's podium though. The concerns that many scouts held about Lafreniere's skating, widely panned as below the NHL average, represented a crack in the armour ripe for another top prospect to exploit. ""I think a lot of people are going to chaIlenge Lafreniere for No. 1 overall,"" one scout told me at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup. ""His feet are a problem."" Correction: his feet were a problem. They're now just a cut above average, as expressed by the 5.5 grade that our OMJHL scout David St-Louis meted to Lafreniere. Everything else? Well, you can read the player's grades, and they're all at or near the top of the chart. It should come as no surprise then that the same is true of Lafreniere's standing among the players accounted for in our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown's tracking project. The SEAL adjusted scoring metric that Jeremy Davis crafted rates Lafreniere as the second-most prolific scorer in his draft class; his draft-season carries a 100 percent XLS rating, too. The name of the game for Lafreniere is deception. There's a harmony between his maneuvers, body language, and positioning in traffic that blurs the lines to the point that they're near-indiscernible for the average defender. He'II present one play with his upper-body language and then exploit the opposition's lack of discretion by furnishing a tape-to-tape pass to a teammate out of the frame for a Grade A scoring chance. As a puck-carrier, Lafreniere attacks through arcs, bending the defensive front and driving the puck like a wedge through any openings that present themselves. He's such an adaptable attacker, maintaining the samegrip on his stick through passes and shots alike, leaving the opposition guessing at every turn. Similarly, Lafreniere doesn't need to choose between pace or patience when determining his plan of attack; he canserve both masters at once. The mental map of the ice that Lafreniere deploys is detailed enough to offer him a wide array ofoptions on the puck, off of the puck, in support of the puck - - you name it! He's never out of the play. And if he does seem out of the play, that's the defenceman's cue to shoulder-check when enroute to the corner for a puck retrieval. Lafreniere is a physically mature 6-foot-1, 192pounds, and he showed during the U20 World Junior Hockey Championships just how willing he is to inflict that upon his opponents when the stakes are at their highest. St-Louis even went so far in Lafreniere's Player Report to suggest that his forechecking is the basisfor a great deal of what he accomplishes offensively. As is so often the case with18-year-olds, Lafreniere has room to grow defensively - - one might wonder whether I'II get more tired of writing it or the audience reading it. He's not especially active defensively, gliding through a low work rate that has him checking in and out of the game at his leisure. Granted, his smarts shine through even the weakest points in his game. Lafreniere takes smart routes to attack the puck-carrier and generally puts himself in the right spots at the right time. There's a basis on which he might growat the next level. Because make no mistake, there is a next level for Lafreniere, and it's the NHL whenever that's a realistic possibility. We rate Lafreniere as a player with elite potential, capable of holding downa first-line spot for many years to come for whichever franchise is lucky enough to call his name."
Quentin Byfield,"Being a scout is equal parts accounting for what's already there and projecting where it's headed. In Sudbury Wolves centre Quinton Byfield, there's more than enough to line either side of the ledger. That's the reason why many pegged Byfield as the prospect most likely to supplant Alexis Lafreniere at first overall. Even if he's not there yet, the combination of size, speed, power, and skill present in Byfield's game offers the best chance of surpassing him at some point down the road. Since the comparison has proven inescapable - - the considerable difference in age between the two warrants our attention. Byfield is less than a month away from qualifying for the 2021NHL Draft; Lafreniere conversely is less thana month removed from last year's draft. That's 312 days apart, nearly a full year, for anyone keeping track. As such, any comparison of the surface level stats that each amassed should pit Byfield's 2019-20 season, in which he scored at a 1.82 points per game pace, against Lafreniere's 2018-19 season, in which he hit the 1.72 mark. All of a sudden, the two don't seem so far apart. How they produce is another matter entirely. It's one area where Byfield couldn't possibly be more distinct from the presumptive first overall pick. Where most skaters seek out space; Byfield carries the puck like a power running back in the NFL does a football headlong into traffic. As our OHL scout Rachel Doerrie has rightly noted in her reports; this propensity to play bumper cars rather than darting away like a drag car racer is a double-edged sword. Teams want players who can operate in the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone, but that's usuaIly a bonus and not the basis on which they operate. Granted, Byfield plays a power forward's game, and this sort of thing comes with the territory to a certain degree. He's blessed with a 6-foot-4 frame, an explosive skating stride, and a set of hands so gifted as to make one wonder if there was a career spent shaping sculptures in a previous lifetime. There's a reason that the league will always covet these types of players. They can take over a shift, a hockey game, a playoff series at the snap of their fingers. These players have left as many impressions on the league's history as its best finishers have the basement drywall in their childhood homes. It's something we've seen from Byfield already on a few occasions in his OHL career. Where some might rightly point to his performance at the U20 World Hockey Championships as a missed opportunity to put on that type performance; I'd counter with moments at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup where Byfield looked miles above the rest of the competition. This is a player who wants the puck on his stick at all times. Byfield is a fantastic transporter of the puck. deploying a wide array of rush patterns to adjust to defensive fronts - - wielding the dotted line to great effect - - and taking the puck to the most dangerous segments of the offensive zone with authority. The data sample that Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown has collected from Byfield's season shows him in the 98th percentile producing zone entries at 5-on-5. The numbers in Brown's data set also help make the case for his strength in the defensive zone. It's a unique tick to Byfield's predominantly instinctual brand of hockey. He's not a player that thinks one or two steps ahead; Byfield plays at pace, attacks with conviction, and has the processing power to react in real-time where others might stall or lose possession. There isn't much that Byfield can't do, and that's why he's the No. 2 ranked player for EliteProspects. It's why we felt tempted at times to bump him up to first overall; even if the urge never overwhelmed us, it was every bit present. I've heard Byfield compared to Eric Lindros in his all too brief prime. One scout I spoke to called him Taylor Hall but at centre, and frankly, it's the rare moment when a player comparison didn't rankle my proprieties. Whatever the case, Byfield has the makings of a No. 1 centre with two-way upside and utility in all three phases. Whoever drafts him is going to be so much better off for it."
Lucas Raymond,"The first tier of players in this year's draft is three skaters long, and it ends with Frolunda winger Lucas Raymond. That's where he started the season, and that's where he'II finish it. That might strike some as bold based on Raymond's surface-level data from a season spent primarily on Frolunda's men's team in the SHL. The 10 points to Raymond's credit through 33 games hardly jump off the page. As always, context is king. Raymond played fourth-line minutes with fourth-line support pieces and only featured sparingly on the second power play unit. Good luck finding an under-20 skater that's going to perform much better under those circumstances. At the very least, it's a much more hostile setting than the CHL, where Alexis Lafreniere and Quinton Byfield. When the three lined up at the U20 World Hockey Championships in December and January, Raymond's quality revealed itself. His 0.57 point per game clip is well ahead of Byfield (0.14), even if Lafreniere's two points per game rate dwarfs both their marks. It's last year's performance at the U18 that established Raymond's legend. The eight points Raymond amassed through seven games were the second-most on Sweden, a hat-trick - - including the overtime goal -- in the Gold Medal Game among them. Those eight points were second only to Russia's Rodion Amirov among draft-minus-one skaters. Simply put: Raymond is the most complete winger in this year's draft. There isn't anything he can't do. Raymond's skating is the matter of some debate in the public and private sphere alike. Nobody seems to rate it as bad, per se, but some would have you believe it's barely above average if that. Don't count us among them. When one puts the puck on Raymond's stick, his two-step explosiveness sees him shoot up the ice as if sent from a cannon. He's a mechanically refined skater, generating straight-line speed with ease, and combining it with lateral quickness and potent weight shifts to skate through and around opponents depending on what the situation calls for. Here's where Raymond really builds separation, if you'll pardon the pun. Where most elite skaters this age only have it in them to play at their top speed; Raymond changes the tempo and pace to create space for himself as a puck-carrier gaining the zone. It took Nathan MacKinnon years in the NHL to figure this out. Raymond's already got it under control. The icing on the cake? Raymond can handle at his top speed, can shoot through his top speed, and he can distribute the puck at his top speed. One might count the number of players in this draft that can perform any one of those tasks at their top speed on one hand. There's a great harmony between Raymond's hands, feet, and even his brain. We've seen him consistently problem-solve against complex defensive arrangements, often working through secondary and tertiary variables in such a way as to advance play, sometimes creating scoring chances out of seeming dead-end situations. He's more of a playmaker than a finisher. Raymond brings an above-average shot and can finish from short-to-intermediate ranges. He's also the type of puck handler that can thrive in small ice scenarios, so there's never much impetus to take low percentage shots - - the data backs this up, too. He'll drive play. He'll drive percentages. He has the potential to be the offensive engine of whichever line hosts him for the majority of his NHL career. In terms of what he'll need to do to hit his ceiling and improve as a player; our Dir. of European Scouting Christoffer Hedlund believes that Raymond will need to play an increased role with Frolunda next season. Added time in the gym won't hurt either. Even so, Hedlund rates Raymond as carrying top-line potential as an elite two-way winger. The risk factor is relatively low with Raymond. One can comfortably invest a high pick in this type of player and not lose sleep. Whether that'll happen or not remains to be seen. Raymond's taken a bit of heat this year for seemingly low boxcar stats and a lack of overwhelming, obvious skill. One has to split hairs this high in the draft. I get it. Whichever team drafts Raymond though is going to be so much better for it. The mature brand of hockey that this 18-year-old Swede brings to the table means that they won't have to wait long to see that payoff in their NHL lineup either. "
Marco Rossi,"It's not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog. Ottawa 67s centre Marco Rossi is the skating, breathing embodiment of that timeless adage. The vertical limitations that come with a  5-foot-9 frame don't represent the end of the list of barriers Rossi had to clear. Born in Feldkirch, Austria, this supremely talented pivot lapped what little competition the non-traditional hockey market had to offer. Perhaps ironically, he was too big a fish in far too small a pond. So, Rossi departed from Austria and competition that was five and sometimes six years his senior for Switzerland, where he played against players four years his senior. His father Michael would drive him to and from the rink, sometimes a three-hour drive. Eventually, Rossi was facing off against men in the Swiss second-tier league, the NLB. That is until the Ottawa 67s invested the 18th pick in the first round of the 2018 CHL Import Draft. Since then, Rossi has lit the OHL on fire, scoring at a torrid 1.70 point per game pace for the 67s. He's done it a number of different ways, posturing as a dual-threat scorer with a statistical split to match - - 68 goals to 117 assists, for those keeping track. Where Rossi's future lies in the NHL is as a distributor though. Expect the assists to come more readily than goals for Rossi in the big leagues. That's where his future lies. Everything one might want in an elite NHL playmaker is already there in abundance in Rossi's game. He's a player with an exceptional sense of spacing both on and off the puck, capable of playing in the most sensitive portions of the offensive zone and suffering hardly any physical wear for the trouble. On the rare occasions that a defender gets within striking distance of Rossi, he'll widen his stance, get low and leverage himself against his opponents like a chair against a door handle. He's a bit of a riverboat gambler with the puck on his stick, goading the opposition into close quarters only to find hist teammates with a tape-to-tape pass in the prime position that they'd just vacated. He'll distribute east-to-west, low-to-high, through levels - - you name it. If there's an opening, then Rossi is going to find it and ruthlessly exploit it. If the defence takes away one option, Rossi is ready to deploy a hook or slip pass, something against the grain, or highly creative feeds on the backhand or forehand to work through it. The shot map that our partners at lnStat Hockey produced offers a valuable bit of insight into the positions from which Rossi is most effective. The vast majority of his shots and goals come from the home plate area that is commonly used as a proxy for scoring chances; he's particularly adept from the left side of the net-front. Granted, this also reveals some of the limitations to Rossi's game. Particularly, the lack of intermediate-to-long range finishing ability. It'sone of the many reasons that Rossi projects so unidimensionally at the next level; his shot simply isn't where it needs to be to beat NHL goaltenders on a regular basis. While Rossi's skating rates as above the NHL average, it's not the engine of his offensive output. It's a bonusthat grants him value through the neutral zone as a puck-carrier and the ability to backcheck and track with aplomb. To quote our OHL regional scout Rachel Doerrie, ""Marco Rossi is one of the most unique players in this draft."" Whether this pint-sized Austrian has it in him to play centre at the NHL level is the only real question one might reasonably harbour about his long-term projection. There aren't many 5-foot-9 pivots, even in an increasingly progressive league. That's more or less where the questions end though. He's not going to win the Selke Trophy, but Rossi is acapable defensive player with great off the puck positioning who dutifully supportshis defencemen below the hashmarks. The offensive gifts are overwhelming, as best evidenced by Rossi's CHL- leading 120 points last season. That's spectacular, even when one accounts for the fact that he's a September birthdate."
Jamie Drysdale,"Erie Otters defenceman Jamie Drysdale could've reasonably laid claim to a spot in the top-five of last year's draft on the strength of his rookie season alone. It's not often a 17-year-old steps into the OHL and puts up 40 points in 63 games playing tough minutes on one of the league's weakest teams. That'll get people's attention. The scouting community couldn't wait to see what Drysdale had planned for an encore. He picked up right where he left off too, leading Canada's blue line as the team captured Silver at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia. The 17 points (five goals and 12 assists) Drysdale amassed through the first 12 games of the OHL season only added an exclamation mark to the ""I'm back"" statement sent in August. Suddenly, I'm talking to scouts who are saying without a moment's hesitation that they'd rather have Drysdale as currently constructed than last year's first defenceman off the board, Vancouver Giants rearguard Bowen Byram. I was a believer, too. How could one not be? Had Drysdale maintained that pace to the end of the season, he would've matched Ryan Ellis' 89 points as the highest output among a first-time draft-eligible defenceman since 1990. Things changed. Drysdale stopped scoring, and that was just symptomatic of a trend that saw him seemingly take his foot off the gas in every facet of his game. Something about wearing his country's colours brings out the best in Drysdale, though, and his second go in Canadian red, this time at the U20 World Hockey Championships reignited the fire from his early-season form. He played a depth role for the most part, but when a combination of illness and injury took Byram out of the semifinals, he filled in admirably and looked the part. The World Juniors may be a 19-year-old's tournament, but Drysdale clearly didn't get the memo. The foundation of Drysdale's game is his skating. He effortlessly carries the puck up-ice with mechanical grace, and his four-way mobility allows him to shimmy through forecheckers unabated. He's in the top quartile as a puck-carrier generating entries and exits at 5-on-5 based on the sample of CHL and USHL data that Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown collected from the 2019-20 season. Because he's able to maintain three-point flexion through his stride; Drysdale's always got his head up, ready to pass the puck on a moment's notice as opportunities present themselves. Where one might quibble with Drysdale's approach through the first two-thirds of the ice is the deference with which he approaches openings that one with his skill set should readily exploit. Whether it's a crisis of confidence or just plain indifference, it's something worth addressing as part of his development plan. To quote one report from David St-Louis, ""he doesn't seem to know he is by far the best skater on the ice."" Presently. Drysdale's skating seems more of a corrective tool than a cudgel to wield against his opponents. Something seems to click as soon as he enters the offensive zone though - - deference turns to horrifying precision. Drysdale is a deceptive operator from the offensive blue line, baiting forwards with false signals through his shoulders and transferring his weight in the opposite direction to attack the newly vacated space. He's more of a playmaker than a shooter, but Drysdale's adaptable first and foremost. He's going to make the best decision regardless of any preference for one type of play rather than the other. Since Drysdale is a defenceman, it only makes sense that we broach his play from, well, the defensive third. It's an area of weakness relative to the other parts of his game. His work rate is suspect, and he's not an especially active on the puck defender, opting rather to contain his opponent than to and dispossess him of the puck. These are minor quibbles, but minor quibbles matter this high in the draft. Ultimately, Drysdale is going to defend by helping his team maintain possession of the puck. The best defence is a good offence, right? Right, and that's why Drysdale is likely to be the first defenceman off the board in October. He's a brilliant skater, capable of quarterbacking a power play with ease and generating results both ways through the neutral zone. He's the only defenceman in this year's draft with clear No. 1 defenceman upside."
Alexander Holtz,"Djurgardens winger Alexander Holtz is the best finisher in this year's draft, and it's not especially close. That was the case going into the season, and he's done his part to hold the throne as we close the book on the 2020NHL Draft. The list of U18 skaters to score more goals than Holtz in the SHL is two players long. Holtz was one goal off the record set by Markus Naslund in 1991. No surprise there. Holtz set the record for goals in the J20SuperElit as a draft-minus-one skater with 30 tallies in 38 contests just one year prior. He'd mercifully moved on to the men's squad this season, but that didn't stop him from scoring over two goals a game through three games of spot duty. His shot is as good as it gets, and it makes him a threat to score from anywhere in the offensive zone. He'II avaiI himself of any opportunity to shoot the puck too, as evidenced by the relatively even distribution of attempts plotted by lnStat in this handy shot chart. What's more, Holtz can let it rip without breaking his stride, a feather in his cap that makes him a unique threat off of the rush. It's just the sort of tool one could reliably build their career around. That seemed to be the plan for Holtz going into this season too. It'd worked for him up to that point, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? The best players are never satisfied, and Holtz's rapacious appetite for improvement informed tremendous growth in every other facet of his game over the course of this season. Simply put: Holtz might be the player who most developed from the start of the year to its conclusion. ""This kid is so, so driven,"" one scout told EliteProspects this season. ""He's always in the weight room, always putting in extra time after practice, always putting in the work."" That's one voice in a chorus of endorsements leaguewide for the player perhaps most admired by the scouting community for their character off of the ice. It's plain to see on the ice, too. Where an unengaged Holtz once floated between the blue lines, he's now backtracking with enthusiasm. Where a passive Holtz once floated towards loose pucks in offensive zone retrievals, he now engages physically and often pins his opponents to the boards in support. He's never going to win a Frank J. Selke Trophy for his defensive work at the next level. His odds are in the same ballpark as the rest of us at EliteProspects. But if Holtz can maintain average or slightly above average defensive metrics at the NHL level, then it's going to make him a much more valuable, reliable player. Similarly, Holtz is never going to lead the league in assists. He's trigger-happy to a fault, and that often comes at the expense of his linemates' opportunities to score in prime positions. Even when Holtz finds himself in an obvious passing situation, his vision often fails him. For Holtz to reach his ceiling, he'll need to add muscle, refine his defensive reads, and just continue along the course he chartered this season. Isn't that just par for the course though? Holtz is a pure sniper as currently constructed, and he has the potential to be a first-line finisher with triggerman utility on the power play. He's a special, special talent, and if he can refine that talent then there's no telling where it might take him. "
Cole Perfetti,"You want to talk about making a good first impression? Cole Perfetti's record-setting12 points (eight goals and four assists) in five games draped in Canadian colours at the 2020 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup is about as good as it gets. Granted, this wasn't anyone's introduction to Perfetti's legend. It was just the first chapter in the second-book. The first was a real hit. The Saginaw sniper put together a 74-point season in 63 games, and his January birth date isn't early enough to dampen the enthusiasm that sort of year rightly elicits. The second chapter was so disorienting a shift as to paint Rian Johnson's cheeks beet red. All of the sudden, Perfetti went from a one-shot finisher in the 99th percentile among his first-time draft-eligible peers to a credible two-way threat with legitimacy as a playmaker. ""Perfetti has an underrated playmaking ability,"" our OHL regional scout Rachel Doerrie remarked around November. ""It's started to show up this season."" The 18-year-old Spirit centre averaged 0.75 assists per game at that point in the season. Then Perfetti found another gear, finishing the year with 1.21helpers on a per game basis. The underlying data is every bit as impressive. Not only did Perfetti complete the highest percentage of his passes - - on a team that included 2019 first-round pick Ryan Suzuki for the back-half of the year - - but he also led the team with an average of 2.07 passes to the slot, according to the data that our partners at lnStat accumulated over the year. If there's a consistent thread that binds every part of Perfetti's game into one cohesive unit: it's his hockey sense. However nebulous a term that may be - -and no matter how far one's mileage varies -- Perfetti has it in spades. He's a cerebral puck carrier, combining a full quiver's worth of rush patterns with the consistent sense to attack in an arc to create as much space or time as is necessary for himself or his linemates. Some skaters blow by traffic: Perfetti manipulates defenders from his path entirely. That he's a remarkably dextrous individual, one capable of blending deception through his passes, be they on the forehand, backhand, slip passes, hook passes, etc. doesn't hurt. His Terminator-esque ability to scan the ice and break down coverages ensure that possession rarely dies on his stick. He'll problem-solve his way through primary, secondary, and even sometimes tertiary variables, advancing play in a threatening posture where most might lose the puck entirely. And when Perfetti does advance the puck in these situations, there's two or three defenders stuck to him at a time - - two or three defenders that his linemates don't have to worry about as they accept possession of the puck. That's by design. While Alexander Holtz locked up honours as the draft's best finisher; Perfetti is the heir apparent to the title. Our scouts haven't seen much deception from Perfetti as a shooter though, which perhaps explains the year-over-year plateauing from his draft-minus-one season to this one at 37 goals - - another explanation is the rule of diminishing returns. He's good enough to take his time and dig with his plant foot before unleashing a precise, powerful wrist shot on goal, and there isn't much that most goaltenders can do to stop him. The cerebral component to Perfetti's game as a shooter mostly lies in his sense of timing and spacing. It's one thing to identify pockets of space within the sensitive portions of the offensive zone; it's another entirely to position one's self appropriately and time their charge just right. ""He's dangerous the second his team is in the offensive zone, because his spatial awareness is so good."" Doerrie remarked in a November report. ""He finds the quiet areas and arrives at the right time for a pass."" Now, the speed with which Perfetti so valiantly attacks those openings is another matter entirely. He entered the year a weak skater, and that's right about where he finished it. Our scouts have identified a hunched over stance on top of a wide base as the limiting factors to Perfetti's stride. He's just a little bit top heavy. Only making matters worse is Perfetti's lack of pace or urgency. He's a nasty tendency of widening his base on entries, pulling a buttonhook maneuver, and gliding around the perimeter for prolonged periods of time with the puck on his stick. It works in the OHL, but a routine that predictable is going to prove costly at the next level. It's hard to imagine a scenario where Perfetti is a centre at the NHL level as a result. He's not a great skater, does a lot of his best work from the perimeter, and doesn't offer much support in the defensive zone either. If one were to borrow Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll's mantra, the more important question is: What can Cole Perfetti do? He's one of the draft's best finishers, with elite offensive instincts and puck skills to match. There's no reason he can't consistently score 35 goals a season at the peak of his career, and every indication from this season is that he'II bring a lot as a distributor, too. "
Tim Stutzle,"It's hard to imagine that anyone saw their stock rise more steadily than Adler Mannheim forward Tim Stutzle did this season, rising from amid-to- late first-round candidate to a lock for the top-five, potentially even the top-three when the draft goes down in October. If only we'd offered consolidated draft rankings at the start of the season. It sure would be nice to have the numbers to back up what seems obvious by intuition. Granted, we're a bit lower than the rest of the industry on Stutzle. We ranked him as the No. 7 prospect in this year's draft on our first board in December, and he's bounced between that spot and No. 8 overall right to the last. One can't help but laugh at the bizarre twist of fate which has us lower on Stutzle than industry consensus after starting the year without much company in his corner. Ain't that something? I'd caution against reading too much into that though. This has a lot more to do with canyon-clearing bounds in development from other players in the top-five or top-ten than it does any stagnation on Stutzle's part. He took some major strides in his own right, going from a player with a deathly fear of the centre lane of the offensive zone to one wiling to take the puck to those parts of the ice consistently near the end of the season. Should he continue to commit himself to that part of the game, there's no telling what sort of damage he'll be able to do in the NHL. His skill level is off the charts good. It's still a bit of a work in progress. Stutzle often peels away from the centre lane before pressure has even arrived, and that's going to need fixing. He's a dextrous handler of the puck with plus-value as a puck carrier, capable of transitioning the puck up-ice all by his lonesome at a blistering pace with the grace of a gazelle, and the hands of a renaissance sculptor. Here's what Dir. of North American Scouting Mitchell Brown had to say of Stutzle's pace and handling ability in a player report that he put together towards the end of the DEL season. ""Incredible control with pace; variety to attack through defenders' triangles and burst through space; adapts grip and reach to changing situations; fights to regain control through traffic and mishandles; adds fakes for misdirection; quickness with soft touch."" Where one might quibble with StutzIe's approach though is the propensity to carve his marble slabs into nothingness, over-handling the puck on entries until he's lost it entirely. Sometimes discretion really is the better part of valour, and it's a lesson that Stutzle is very much in the process of learning. ""He always looks to stickhandle through traffic rather than use passing triangles and creating advantages; sets up dekes with a wide glide and stick in front - - easy to dispossess with a limited speed advantage (instead of attacking with a series of crossover and/or opening up hips into a heel-to-heel); drops head to make an extra dangle instead of pass."" Some players problem-solve against primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. variables; Stutzle troubleshoots. To quote TSN's Dir. of Scouting Craig Button ""Stutzle takes the game by the throat."" He's not looking to advance play through a deceptive hook or slip pass; he's hoping to maneuver through numbers, and to quote the venerable Han Solo, with ""never tell me the odds"" mentality. There isn't much that Stutzle can't do as a passer either. He'll work from range, through traffic, through layers, and whether there's pressure or space - - he's getting that puck to his teammate. He's a technically gifted distributor of the puck with elite vision when he slows the game down a bit, particularly when he sets up shop on the left half-wall on the man advantage. Given his natural handling ability, playmaking prowess, high-end hockey sense, and an unrelenting motor; Stutzle profiles, in some ways, as a centre at the NHL level. That was his position prior to joining Adler Mannheim this year in the DEL. We're skeptical, leaning towards a future on the wing at the NHL level. We haven't ruled out the possibility of a transition to centre at some point. Take Vancouver Canucks centre Elias Pettersson's arc as one example of a player bucking the odds on that front. He hardly took any shifts at centre in his draft and draft-plus-one season. Then he was a top-ten centre in the NHL as a 20-year-old in his draft-plus-two season - - go figure1 Probability isn't destiny, right? Stutzle took a good number of reps at centre at the U20 World Junior Hockey Championship, and there are some in the industry who maintain that this was his best hockey alI season. There is a proof concept. Whatever position Stutzle plays, he has 60- 70 point upside at the NHL level as a top-line playmaker with significant power play utility. Those players are hard to find. If you can get one in the range we've rated Stutzle in, then you're laughing all the way to the bank. Odds are he'll begone much sooner though."
Jake Sanderson,"There's a theory in some scouting circles that the USHL is a criminally under-covered league, and USNTDP U18 defenceman Jake Sanderson might be a skating example of just that. The games stopped, and Sanderson's stock kept on soaring. It's amazing what added exposure can do for a player's stock when everyone has the time to check the film. We just might be guilty as sin on this charge, too. Sanderson creeped towards the top-ten before the hockey world paused, but it's the time we've spent investigating his game since that has vaulted him firmly into the mix. When I say firmly in the mix; I mean firmly in the mix. There really isn't much room between Sanderson and our top-rated defenceman Jamie Drysdale of the OHL's Erie Otters, our No. 5 ranked skater in the upcoming draft. Stylistically, of course, they are world's apart. We love to bet on upside, and Drysdale's offensive defensive stylings lend itself to just that. Sanderson, on the other hand, is the rare jack of all trades, somehow also amaster of all trades player. He doesn't play with a level of offensive dynamism that we've come to expect of defenceman with this sort of price tag, but he does everything at an above-average to high-end level right across the board. It all starts in the feet for Sanderson. He's an elite skater, layering nimble ankle flexion through a 90-degree kneebend, with fluidity through his hips. His boot placement allows for the maximum generation of power through the entirety of the blade, withhis feet underneath his knees as the mark of a welI- placed stride recovery. The forcemultiplier on Sanderson's skating is the authority and decisiveness with which he plays. There's no hesitation on Sanderson's part when closing on an opponent, angling intoa board battle, or sprinting into a pocket of space. If the player I've thus far described sounds likean ace in transition, that's with good reason. Dir. of North American Scouting MitchBrown had this to say in a June meeting: ""Sanderson is the best transitional defenceman I've come across in four-plus years of collecting this data."" It goes both ways, too. Sanderson is Gandalf at the Bridge of Kazad Oum, making clear at every turn that you shall not pass - - do me a solid and just suspend the memory of how that scene ends for a moment.' Sanderson does an excellent job of mitigating risk with his footwork, timing his c-cuts well, andguiding the puck-carrier calmly to within his reach, at which point hedrives the shoulder through his opponent and eliminates possession. If Sanderson finds himself in a position to collect the puck; he immediately turns place up-ice, whether it's with a welI-placed stretch pass or by carrying it himself through traffic. He's not afraid to use the middle of the ice,andhe's surprisingly nimble in transition for someone who isn't especially skilled, handling the puck ably on the forehand, the backhand, and integrating slipandhook passes in sticky situations. Where one arrives at skepticism with Sanderson's game is what happens when the puck is in the offensive zone. He's doubtless shown significant development this season as a creative distributor, and he started to flash some serious puck skills before the stoppage in play. It's just that he started from a fairly limited spot; even drastic improvement doesn't put him in the upper echelon of offensive defencemen in this year'sdraft. Mostly, Sanderson creates through rush activation and as a trailing option on developing rush plays. Here's what Joey Padmanabhan, our USHL scout,had to say about Sanderson's offensive skill set in a player report on the North Dakota committed defenceman. ""Without the puck, Sanderson recognizes appropriate times to join the rush and pinches on opposing wingers well, sealing off pass options along the boardsand, in turn, preventing breakouts. He's got a quick wrister as well that can create havoc"" There are no such questions about Sanderson's ability to defend. On the puck, off the puck - - he's full value, likely the best in-zone defender in the entire class. He's calculated, disciplined, physical, and creative. There just isn't much that he can't do in the defensive zone at an exceptionally high level. Then there are, of course, the intangible qualities. Talk to anyone who's had the chance to interview Sanderson, on the media or the team side, and they'll all rave about his quality as a leader and a stand-up kid. We value upside first and foremost at EliteProspects, and Sanderson has everything it takes to develop intoa No. 2 or 3 defenceman with value in all three phases of special teams at the next level. It doesn't sound sexy, especially for a player in this range, but it's a result most teams wi11 take any day of the week around tenth overalI. "
Anton Lundell,"If his draft stock is any indication, HIFK centre Anton Lundell might've just put together one of the most under-appreciated U19 seasons in Liiga history. It's not often first-time draft-eligible skaters hold down a regular spot in the Finnish men's league. Seasons in which those skaters score at over a half a point per game clip are even less frequent. There are only 16 players (11if we shrink the sample to the last 20 seasons) to suit up for 40 games or more in the Finnish Liiga in their first-year of draft-eligibility and hit the half a point per game mark. Lundell ranks eighth in the group, with 28 points in 44 games coming at a 0.64 per game rate. It's hard to imagine anyone in that group matched Lundell's two-way impact either. ""[Lundell's] two-way numbers reached absurd heights as HIFK controlled 61.9 percent of the shot attempts at 5-on-5,"" Lassi Alanen, our Finnish regional scout, remarked in an article on the steady Finn's game. ""That Corsi rate is the second-best mark in the league among qualifying players."" Perhaps some of it is just bad luck? Where prospects like Tim Stutzle, Lucas Raymond, and Alexis Lafreniere had the chance to shine under the bright lights on the U20 World Hockey Championships stage; Lundell had to withdraw from the tournament at the last minute due to injury. The more likely reason for Lundell's drop is his playing style. He's a quietly effective two-way pivot without any obvious skills that jump off the screen and demand one's attention. Lundell is sometimes at his best when one doesn't really notice him at all. Everything about Lundell's game is methodical and calculated. He's thinking two or three steps ahead of his opponents at any given moment. That perspicacity is a survival mechanism as much as anything else. Lundell's skating stride isn't going to win him any footraces for loose pucks. It's not going to cover for any mistakes. If he's not thinking two or three steps ahead, the flow of play is liable to leave him one or two steps behind. Lundell is limited by a relatively short stride for someone with his stature. His knee-bend is far from the desired 90 degrees, and there is a lack of ankle flexion which limits the power he can generate out of every extension. His stride recovery lands well outside his frame, and he struggles to get his feet beneath his knees, too. It's just a series of mechanical skating failures heaped on top of each other. This lack of explosiveness limits Lundell's ability to create off of the rush in anything beyond a supporting capacity. It's much less of an issue during established offensive zone possessions though. His off the puck habits, whether it's driving the net or being mindful of his spacing, create a ton of room for his linemates. Lundell has a good habit of finding pockets of space in the offensive zone and making himself a passing option for his linemates, too. There's some belief among our group that Lundell is only scratching the surface of his potential as a goal-scorer, too. Alanen remarked on Lundell's shot in a player report that ""his release can beat goalies from distance - - smart placement, and he can sneak shots past defender's legs, etc."" He has a valuable resource for improving in this realm too in his father, Jan Lundell, the goalie coach for HIFK. Lundell told EP Rinkside's Russ Cohen that he's been learning how to better understand goaltenders alI season so that he might learn how to pick them apart as a sniper. Ultimately, LundeII is going to generate much of his value in the defensive zone. That's where he's at his best. He's so hard on the puck; an eager combatant in puck battles with a track record in those contests that matches his enthusiasm. Even if Lundell's 6-foot-1,187-pound frame doesn't seem that imposing; it's almost all muscle, and he's a tough customer. His reads off of the puck are great, too. Rare is the moment where Lundell is out of position, and you'll never have to worry about him flying the zone early. There just aren't many players with a higher floor than LundeII. He's bound to ingratiate his coaches with his no-nonsense approach and defensively sound posture, and that counts for a lot. It's easy to project Lundell into a middle-six role with penalty killing utility at the NHL level. He's just about a guarantee to stick at centre, too. If we didn't value upside more than, well, just about anything - - that might be enough to vault Lundell to somewhere around fifth-overall. As is, he settles in closer to ten."
Yaroslav Askarov,"The performance of Sergei Bobrovsky in the postseason - combined with his massive, all-in contract from the Florida Panthers - has understandably reignited the debate about where Russian prospect Yaroslav Askarov should go in the draft. IdeaIly, a team that sincerely needs a goaltender to boost up their pipeline in the next two-ish years will snag him within the top 10 to 15 picks. He's miles ahead of the other goaltenders available in the draft, and his development - not to mention his development path, which have seen him already thriving in the pros - make him an easy bet as a goaltender who will be NHL-ready sooner rather than later. But making sure he's given room to grow - - something that first-round picks at other positions are afforded with sheltered starts - - could be tricky for a team struggling to provide adequate defence in front of him. I'd stilI peg him as a top-10 pick, but he'll be interesting to consider nonetheless. Smart, and already remarkably controlled for his age, Askarov has all the agility and eye-opening movement range you'd expect from a Russian-developed goaltender, but with an added level of control to his game that few his age can boast. His skating is above average - - although that's no longer a distinguishing factor to the degree it was five or ten years ago - - but what really makes him stand out is the way he utilizes a range of depth management to effectively make the most of his wide stance, fluid movements, and fast feet. He has incredible reaction speed, but you don't see as many 'desperation' saves as one might expect from a goaltender who has the kind of movement he does; instead, he does a good job of controlling himself within the blue paint when he needs to and he's difficult to pull out of position by holding sustained pressure on his team's end of the ice. Occasionally you'll catch him over-sliding, but he's got good tracking and recovery mechanisms. When talking with other goaltending evaluators over the last year, Askarov's glove hand has been one of the biggest areas of concern - although there are multiple theories on why that may be. There's a chance that his lower-body movement and depth management has been the priority, especially as he's moved up the ranks so quickly within the Russian hockey system. He's gone from playing junior hockey to the VHL, then to the KHL, alI as a teenager; with a drastically different skiII set and game pace at each level, it's possible that tailoring his mental game and his depth management to his current situations has been the priority while he leaves his hands developed in practice, but not the area of focus when it comes to the long haul of a season. Another possible explanation was given by a fellow goaltending evaluator when we talked about Askarov back in May. His theory was that Askarov's positioning - which see him utilize the kind of wide, low butterfly that Bobrovsky has made so popular during the height of his career - leaves him vulnerable visibility-wise up high. That means that even if his hands are active, he isn't going to be quite as efficient with them as someone who covers more space over the top half of the net. It's an interesting possibility, especially given that Finnish goaltenders sometimes manage to play both wide and low and with incredibly active hands. But ultimately, Askarov is still just eighteen; having struggles with his glove hand as his main area of concern is hardly anything worth scoffing over. "
Seth Jarvis,"It was a tale of two seasons for Portland Winterhawks forward Seth Jarvis. Don't believe me? Check the splits. Jarvis put up 37 points (15 goals and 22 assists) through the first half of the season; he followed that up with 61points (27 goals and 34 assists) on the back nine, a figure that unto itself would warrant first-round consideration. Granted, one scores at that rate from seemingly out of nowhere and worthwhile questions about how much of those results are sustainable and how much are smoke and mirrors are bound to arise. The good people at Pick224 had Jarvis converting on nearly 20 percent of his shots in all situations. Our partners at lnStat have Jarvis down for about 27 expected goals, a number set by the frequency and location of his shots - - the inference there is that Jarvis produced15goals more than he should have last season. High-end finishers have proven capable of carrying higher percentages in the CHL than we're accustomed to seeing at higher levels of hockey. The talent variance allows for the cream of the crop to rise to the top of the stats page annually, without fail. Even so, Jarvis was doubtless on the receiving end of a fair share of puck luck. That's not where the conversation ends though. Hell, we're barely getting started. Now that we've wrapped the boxcar stats in the appropriate context, let's go ahead and lay the qualitative basis on which they'll comfortably rest. Where to start? It's a surprisingly difficult question to answer. Jarvis is the unique player that does everything relatively well. There's no one standout tool driving his success, just a layering of plus abilities that make for a whole that's so much better than the sum of its parts. His ability to work in tight spaces seems as good a place as any. Our Dir. of North American Scouting, Mitch Brown, has identified Jarvis' gravitational pull, and the ability to create with a defender draped on top of him as one of the strong suits of his game. ""Jarvis is one of the best attackers in the draft with a defender on his back; he seeks out pressure with gear-changes or stops-and-starts, then creatively pulls away with an arsenal of moves: fully-weighted cutbacks exited with a crossover at the apex, independent-moving hands for added deception, give-and-goes and passing threats."" Brown continued. ""again, with a defender on his back, he can find teammates across the slot (even trailers) with regularity; Jarvis is a true dual-threat attacker."" He's the type of player who wants the puck on his stick, wants to carry the puck up the ice, wants to be the focal part of his team's offensive game plan. With a strong base of habits as a skater, including the deployment of crossovers through the neutral zone to build acceleration - - Jarvis has the foundation to be that player. His strong puck skills take it to the next level though. Jarvis can pass, shoot, or receive tricky passes through his stride. He keeps the puck within a safe distance and protects it well through small-ice scenarios. And one needn't worry about him missing a passing or shooting opportunity by overhandling. While we're confident in Jarvis' ability as a true dual-threat scorer, it's more of a 60-40 split for playmaking than goal-scoring. We've already broached the elevated percentages and the extent to which that perhaps inflated his goal totals. The other component is that Jarvis hasn't displayed a consistent ability to finish from intermediate-to-long-range. Most of his goals came from relatively close to the opposing goal. That's not a knock, by any means. It speaks to Jarvis' fearlessness, and that's just another feather to add to the plume in his cap. It's just that I'd be cautious about projecting him as an elite finisher at the next level as a result. He's got a wide array of releases, can change the angles on his shot, and can generate a fair bit of power on his wrist shot with very little wind up. There's something there, certainly. There's a pretty compelling toolkit at Jarvis' disposal, and it's one that's taken him from a fringe first-round pick to a potential top-ten selection in October. There aren't many flaws in his game, and if he keeps on this same path then there's a chance he could be a dynamic top-six forward at the NHL level."
Mavrik Bourque,"No two scouts share the same opinion of our draft guide's next subject, Shawinigan Cataractes centre Mavrik Bourque. ""I cannot believe how high you guys rated Bourque,"" was a common refrain when I'd pass on our rankings to scouts across the NHL. ""Bourque takes way too many nights off"" was another. The tone changed significantly when one broached Bourque to his coaches, teammates, etc. ""I really liked Mavrik Bourque,"" Team Canada head coach Michael Dyck told EliteProspects at the 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup when asked who was the unsung hero of the team."" ""His skill level is at a high, high-level,"" Team Russia centre Vasili Ponomaryov told EliteProspects at the World Junior A Challenge in Dawson Creek. ""Right now, I can tell you he's a great player with a bright future."" Daniel Renaud, the general manager for the Cataractes in the QMJHL. offered a paean for the 18-year-old pivot when our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown spoke to him over the phone at about the midway point in the season. ""I've known Mav for a year and a half, and last year was pretty hard for us because we were young, young, young, and at 16, he was already that go-to guy. I trust Mav like no one else. His hockey IQ is unreal. I've been in the Q for the last seven years, and he has the best hockey IQ I've seen. Out of nothing, he's going to make plays that no one else can see on the ice. ""And, even though he's not physically mature -- there's still some improvement to be made there, like physically getting stronger - - I love the way he protects the puck. He's very effective at putting the puck at the proper space so he can protect the puck. Then, making contact and then spin to create space; he's going to use the opponent to create space on the ice. He's always going to wait to bring one or two players on him; if there's only one player on him, he's getting more and more patient with the puck - - and he's getting more and more effective at it. As soon as he feels two or three players are getting sucked in at him, then, he's going to make a play. And obviously, it's going to be a scoring chance."" ""He's so good at bringing [defenders] to him. On the powerplay, he's very effective, and on the PK, too, which is very impressive for an offensive player. My job now is to limit or control his ice time, because I'd play him on first line, first PP, first PK, first 5-on-5, big faceoffs - - I'd put him everywhere on the ice. But he's 17, and we get to play 68-plus games, so, right now, he's playing the PP for sure, and he's more at the end of the PK, like third PK unit, but he can play both special teams and be very, very effective."" Mavrik Bourque, it's a land of contrasts. There's the gist of it. Clearly, we find ourselves landing on the side of Bourque's teammates and coaches most often. Whether that comes back to bite us in the ass or not remains to be seen, but that's par for the course at the draft. So much of what Renaud, in particular, had to say about Bourque's game resonates with our assessment. It all starts upstairs for Bourque. He's the master manipulator, blending layers of deception one on top of the other, duping the opposition into sheer disarray at every turn. There's no tell on his shot. Bourque can generate a ton of power through his wrist shot even when it's well outside his frame, and he doesn't need a big wind-up to do it. He's got a wide array of releases and avails himself of the best one for any given moment. If that's not enough, he wields the threat of a shot as a means of drawing opponents into his space before dispatching of the puck to a teammate who's just gained valuable real estate as a result. He's an able distributor with a thorough mental map of the ice that aIlows him to find teammates in smalI-ice and big- ice scenarios alike. With the occasional head fake or a change of speed; he's shown a real knack for thinking defencemen out of passing lanes and exploiting their lack of discretion. There aren't any real dynamic qualities to Bourque's game as a handler, but he makes do in tight spaces by reading incoming pressure and reacting accordingly, rarely overhandling the puck and often finding a way to problem-solve his way out of a corner. One of the big questions concerning Bourque's game is what happens once he enters the defensive zone. The scouts we've spoken to over the course of the year have less than no time for Bourque's defensive coverage or his work rate. It's the major source of much of their skepticism. We're not projecting any Selke trophies in Bourque's future, but he's a pretty smart off of the puck player in the defensive third. He consistently tracks well through the neutral zone and applies back-pressure more often than not. It's the work rate that we can't contest. We'd love to see Bourque apply himself more consistently in the defensive zone and work harder on 50/50 pucks. We've seen him flat-out give up on plays far, far too often. Was Bourque pacing himself? It's a worthwhile question. The data that our friends at InStat Hockey accumulated from Bourque's season have him playing more than any other first-time draft-eligible skater in the CHL not named Alexis Lafreniere. Similarly, one can't help but wonder what would happen to Bourque on another, deeper, more offensively skilled team. How much of Bourque's production can be chalked up to opportunity? Would he play more of a secondary role on a deeper team? Even so, these are minor quibbles given the skill level and hockey sense that Bourque brings to the table. He's a true dual-threat scorer with top-six centre upside at the NHL level."
Dawson Mercer,"Blink, and you're liable to miss what makes Chicoutimi Sagueneens centre Dawson Mercer so special. Sure, there are the ten-bell maneuvers that jump off the screen. Those are pretty neat. It's the way that Mercer sets those moves up that makes them so special though. We don't usually think of players who carry themselves like renaissance painters as the game's great thinkers. We're conditioned to believe that it's overwhelming skill, and that's that. Mercer is different. He picks apart on-the-puck defenders in much the same way an elite NFL quarterback breaks down defensive coverages - - one read, one component at a time. Mercer deploys a wide array of false signals to trick defenders out of space, to pivot one direction with every intention of quickly transferring his weight in the opposite one. The same is true of his shot. There often isn't any indication or warning that a shot is coming off of Mercer's stick. He can one-time the puck in difficult small-ice scenarios, and that's just an extension of his sublime ability to corral even the most difficult passes through traffic. It's all about the setup. It always is with Mercer. He'll avail himself of any opportunity to make a screen of an opposing defender, and often changes the release point through his shooting motion to get pucks through feet, shin pads, etc. If there's anything Mercer can do to deceive, blind, or catch an opposing netminder off guard - - he'll mercilessly do precisely that. Think of it as an evolutionary mechanism in Mercer's game - - this cerebral, thinking person's approach. If one can't skate at ahigh-level and they're not towering over their opponents, then they best have a handle on how to out think the opposition at every turn. This is very much so the case for Mercer, who is a below average skater endeavouring to play the position perhaps most dependent on one's ability to, well, skate - - centre. He's got very, very heavy feet, and they limit his ability to execute linear and non-linear crossovers, thus limiting his ability to generate speed. It's also a limiting factor when Mercer tries to emerge from his stance, with little if any two-step quickness. To Mercer's credit, he's a pretty crafty skater. Stop me if you've heard this before, but he's a thoughtful skater. He'll send false signals through his shoulders to force defenders through the neutral zone to commit with a pivot and then skate directly into their blind spot. It's something that we see a lot from the smarter players in the game. Our Dir. of North American scouting Mitch Brown put together a pretty great breakdown of Mercer's skating in this article from August on the 18-year-old prospect. ""That Mercer's not finding separation in the QMJHL with his feet is, at the very least, a bit concerning. His stride lacks a bit of depth, failing to extend his knees over his toes and not sitting back deep enough into stride. The lack of depth transfers to his crossovers, where he's unable to properly cross one skate over the other, essentially placing one in front of the other. He completes his crossovers exclusively on his inside edge. By not including his outside edge, he doesn't receive any glide time - he just pushes and pushes, rather than push, glide, push. It's inefficient, but not cripplingly so; some players just weren't meant to go fast. "" Another way that Mercer makes up for his deficiencies as a skater is by playing a counter-attacking style and moving the puck with a great deal of pace. His hands move at an exceptional speed. too. The way he thinks the game? Well, you know. There is some skepticism among our group whether Mercer is going to play centre at the next level. There's the skating - - that's an issue. There's also the matter of Mercer's propensity to wander a bit and make questionable off the puck reads. There's no doubting his work rate though - - that's one feather in his cap Our skepticism has dissipated with time this scouting season though, for whatever that's worth. David St-Louis, our OMJHL regional scout. is confident Mercer can hold down the middle of the ice at the NHL level. That helps build Mercer's case as a pretty special, valuable prospect in this range. He's a credible triple-threat player. There isn't much he can't do, aside from winning the fastest skater competition at All-Star Games. "
Brendan Brisson,"Chicago Steel centre Brendan Brisson got better with every passing viewing this season. I left the USHL Fall Classic last September with nothing but skepticism for the son of legendary player agent Pat Brisson's. As we turn the calendar on October for the 2020 Draft, I'm a believer. It was his performance at the World Junior A Challenge that really opened our eyes. I was there with Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown for the entire tournament, and we could hardly believe what we were seeing. His skating had improved. He was more confident with the puck. He put himself in positions to let his one-timer rip, and there was nothing goalies could do to stop it. His coach was deploying him in high-leverage defensive situations. He was a new player. All told, Brisson left the tournament with 12 points in 6 games, good for the tournament lead, tied with Andrei Svechnikov and Nick Schmaltz for the WJAC scoring record. He had four periods to break from the pack, but the USA went cold in the semifinals and that was that. That was Brisson's coming out party. Upon returning to the Steel from the WJAC, he went on a tear, scoring six points in his first two games back in a second-half sprint to the finish. He's playing four-dimensional chess; the opposition is playing checkers. However one defines hockey sense; Brisson has it in spades. He's the best problem-solving forward in the draft not named Alexis Lafreniere The gears are always turning. Brisson skates into pressure to deploy a gravitational pull on the opposition, and has the good sense to either quickly dispatch of the puck to a teammate in space or processes his way through it one defender at a time. It's like watching Terminator's visual machinery break down every obstacle in its path; hostile, friendly, their weaknesses, etc. He's constantly moving his feet off of the puck too, playing a game of cat and mouse with opposing defenders, tricking them into vacating dangerous spots in the offensive zone, and stealing the space. It's like that episode of The Simpsons where the carnies trick Homer out of his own house. Then - - whether on the power play or at 5-on-5 -- he'II receive the pass with the swift, thunderous force of a one-timer that's hard to process even as a spectator. He can get that shot off from any part of the offensive zone, with his body contorted in any position. It's special. To quote Brown, ""he's got a shot that could be the basis for a fruitful NHL career unto itself."" Much like Seth Jarvis and Mavrik Bourque; Brisson is a true dual-threat scorer. There's the gravitational pull, the pace with which he plays, the strong off of the puck habits, and an elite shot. He's an interesting skater, with more strong habits than bad, but stilI very much so a work in progress. His posture tends to sag from time-to-time, and that limits the amount of explosiveness that he can generate through his stride. His stride is also marked by a wide recovery. He's sometimes vulnerable to a toe-kick on his extension, too. Generally, these mechanical issues reveal themselves most prominently late in shifts and games. It's fair to wonder whether conditioning has a part to play in these inefficiencies, but I'm not especially convinced. The simple explanation here is probably the right one - - it's more of a focus issue. He seems cognizant of his limitations as a puck-carrier though. Mostly, Brisson puts the puck in one of his linemates hands, and let's them do the legwork. One can apply the same principles about Brisson's defending skating to his in-zone defending. He plays with good habits, mostly, but a lack of focus tends to take him out of the picture from time-to-time. He's guilty of focusing a little too much on transitioning to offence and not putting in the work to facilitate that shift safely and effectively. These are minor quibbles - - the types of things one can develop. It's a lot more difficult if not outright impossible to teach someone to think the game the way that Brisson does. The question our staff often hears in response to this affinity for Brisson's game is: What about his environment? The Chicago Steel scored the most goals in the USHL by a significant margin, and surely that has something to do with Brisson's 24 goals and 35 assists in 45 games. Here's the thing: Brisson was second on the team in scoring to Mathieu De St. Phalle, and the two didn't often play on the same line, at least not in our viewings. Mostly, Brisson played with Sean Farrell and Gunnarwolfe Fontaine. And you know what? He was driving that bus most games. There aren't many players in this draft that have first- line centre upside in the NHL - - Quinton Byfield, Marco Rossi, Bourque, and Brisson. Whether these players get to that point or not is another matter entirely. As the ranking makes clear, Brisson might not have the best odds of getting there, but we rate it as a distinct possibility. That counts for a lot. Even if he's short one spot in the lineup; a second-line centre with power play utility is a hell of a get in the middle of the first-round. "
Jack Quinn,"Ottawa 67s sniper Jack Quinn just produced one of the least heralded 50-goal seasons in recent memory. Neither the league nor the context often matters when one ascends to those lofty heights. It's an accomplishment that commands respect first, and rarely if ever warrants a scrutinous gaze in the aftermath. It's not difficult to see from where any sort of skepticism might arise in Quinn's case though. The 67s were an offensive buzzsaw, and its central piece, Marco Rossi (remember him?), led the OHL in points. Now, granted, Quinn spent most of his time at 5-on-5 away from Rossi, but the two shared the ice often with the man advantage. Quinn, of course, scored 15 of his 52 goals on the power play, while connecting on one out of every five or so shots at that. He's also four days removed from being eligible for the 2019 Draft, and we know the effect that even the most modest differences in age have on a player's development at this stage in their life. Is it starting to make a bit more sense? Now that we've contextualized Quinn's output statistically, let's build the profile for the player through a wider lens. It should come as no surprise that the player I'm describing fits the mold of a shoot-first sniper. That's Quinn. He's always manipulating opposing defencemen as a puck-carrier, baiting a response, and then threading the puck through the opening this sequence created. He'll often feign a passing play, but defenders rightly don't bite all that often on those. That's when he strikes. Ruthlessly, with precision. Quinn can get a ten-bell shot off on either foot, and he deploys a wide array of release points to ensure that the puck gets through any manner of situations. He's not a plus-skater, by any means, but he's strong on his edges, effortlessly works weight transfers, and can shimmy through traffic and into the slot. He's a pretty smart player off of the puck, too. Quinn is always reading the defensive coverage and looking for soft spots to strike. He has a refined sense of timing, too, and generally puts himself into these prime positions at just the right moment. You have to be a fairly elite shooter to outperform expected goals models to the degree that Quinn did last season. lnStat has him down for about 33 expected goals in all-situations; that's almost 20 short of the actual number he furnished. Even if some of that is luck, it's a pretty impressive feat. He's not a good enough passer to realistically threaten from that posture. A consistent theme through Quinn's season, as expressed by our series of game reports. is an inability to either find teammates in prime scoring positions or poor timing, velocity. on the passes that are trying to find those players. David St-Louis had this to offer on Quinn's passing in a game report from a February 23rd match against the Sudbury Wolves. ""Quinn lacks timing on his passes. He sometimes misses better positioned teammates and when he does see them, he doesn't get them the puck in the best possible space to enable their next plav, unlike the better plavmakers in the draft. The puck arrives on their stick too late or off-target. I think it's partlv a consequence of Quinn's confidence in his ability to open shooting lanes."" The data that our good friends at lnStat Hockey collected from Quinn's season with the 67s tends to back up this assessment. He's third-worst on the team among regular skaters in pass completion percentage and only fourth on the team in passes to the slot, in spite of playing the most alI-situations minutes of any forward on the team. He's the ultimate singular-threat, one-dimensional player, but that's hardly a knock on Quinn considering that his one-dimension (goal-scoring) is the most important dimension in hockey. He's about an above average skater, mostly mechanically fine with sound habits, but lacks explosiveness, something that could perhaps improve with added muscle. Similarly, he's a pretty decent defensive piece, committed to playing hard on the puck and making excellent reads off of the puck. You'll never have to shelter this player. We're not sure if Quinn will ever find twine at the next level with anywhere near the efficacy of his OHL career, but that's a pretty obscenely high bar to set anyway. He's a good bet to be a 20-plus goal-scorer at the NHL level. and those players are hard to find. "
Rodion Amirov,"This may come as some surprise, but Russia's Rodion Amirov was the leading scorer at the U18 World Hockey Championships last year, not Lucas Raymond. Amirov's nine points (six goals and three assists) through eight contests actually led Russia period, and were good enough to hold a four-way tie for seventh in the tournament in scoring. That's a hell of a way to announce one's self ahead of their first season of draft-eligibility. It's also the single greatest proof of concept for Amirov's game breaking ability, something we didn't see a great deal of in a year spent bouncing between the MHL, KHL, and VHL in Salavat Yulaev Ufa's system. That's more observation than critique though. Amirov didn't play a ton in the KHL, featuring on the fourth line and sparingly at that, and only sipped a five-game cup of coffee in the VHL. The MHL is, well... it's no refuge for the skilled. That's not to say the skill level or competence isn't there. He strikes with strong habits, deploying crossovers through arced attacks on the rush, made all the more potent with a nice variety of rush patterns through the neutral zone preceding these forays. Where Amirov could stand to grow a fair bit is in mitigating the one bad habit that sometimes creeps into these plays, as he's liable to often widen his stance once he's changed his angle, aIlowing for the back-tracking forwards to close on him at the top of the offensive zone. It's something that cost him possession fairly frequently last season, but it's hardly a death knelI. It's something Amirov can easily work on with time. The more projectable elements of Amirov's strike patterns include the willingness to manipulate defenders between the blue lines and a willingness to play pucks into space. If that wasn't enough, Amirov's integrated the boards into his array of outlets as a passing tool, both to himself and his teammates. The basis of all this is, of course, Amirov's skating. He's so mechanically refined in this area of the game. He achieves full 90-degree knee-bend, with three-way flexion starting at the ankles, through the knees, and into the hips. His stride lands well within his frame, and the boot is tucked nicely underneath his knee. He achieves full-extension on his strides as a matter of habit. Any room for improvement in this realm is going to come from work in the weight room, and that's actually a fairly consistent theme throughout his game -- this was especially true in our viewings of Amirov at the KHL level. To his credit, Amirov works well within those limitations, even when applying pressure on the forecheck. In an ode to the Russian hockey of yesteryear, Amirov forechecks and backchecks like a sheepdog herding their flock. With a thorough mental map of the ice and everyone's positions, he funnels opposing breakouts to the parts of the ice where he has the most support, allowing for turnovers and quick counter plays. He's a bit of a dual-threat player, but the majority of his offensive contributions are the result of high-level puck-handling and distributing. His shot doesn't rate especially well, and he's not a capable one-touch finisher, often bobbling the puck in prime scoring positions. He's a heady shooter though and he creates a lot with well-placed shots that lead to rebounds or rely more on their precision than power. His anticipation, the ability to see plays before they develop, is another high-level tool in his toolkit. The strength of Amirov isn't that he's an intermediate or long-range finisher; it's that he finds ways to funnel the puck into high-danger areas where an elite shot isn't necessary to produce. To that exact end, Amirov is going to need to add a fair bit of muscle if he's going to bring this style of hockey with him as he climbs the professional ranks. It's already proven something of an obstacle at the KHL level. Still, there are a lot of nice, projectable qualities to Amirov's game. Even if he doesn't bring elite, top of the lineup talent to the fold, it's easy to imagine a scenario where he develops into a reliable top-six contributor at both ends of the ice with utility in both phases of special teams. I'II take that at this point in the draft. "
Dylan Holloway,"Count Dylan Holloway among the handful of Wisconsin skaters that want a do-over on last season. Pretty much everyone on that team not-named Cole Caufield fell well short of expectations. And enough of them got out of dodge with entry-level contracts or graduated that Holloway is likely to centre a line with Caufield next season, so that's nice. In the interim, it's safe to say that some of the shine has come off Holloway over the course of his draft-year. He seemed earmarked for a top-ten pick after making a big statement at last year's U18 World Hockey Championships and then featuring in relatively prominent role on a major NCAA program. At the very least, the top-half of the first-round seemed feasible. Now, Holloway is likely to go closer to 20. We've ranked him 18th, and our the Consolidated Draft Rankings on our Draft Center page has him one spot higher at 17th. Most of the industry sources we've consulted with over the course of the season all seem to rate Holloway lower than the public sphere, though, so take that bit of information however you please. It's a question of upside this high in the draft, and nothing about this season gave the impression that Holloway is brimming with that quality. He's no slouch, obviously, but I don't think anyone is pencilling him into the first-line of their future at this point. There's no reason Holloway couldn't develop into a middle-six forward with two-way credibility though. That counts for something. It's the one part of his game that took a big, big stride this season - - the defensive side of the equation. Holloway featured primarily in a third-line checking role, anchoring a line with Tarek Baker and the Smol King Sean Dhooghe on opposite flanks. That trio took on the tough match-ups and ate a healthy serving of defensive zone starts at 5-on-5. For their trouble, they left with a plus-two shot attempt differentiaI. The totality of the shot attempt data that our partners at lnStat Hockey collected from Wisconsin's season shows the heady two-way pivot as owing to the team's sixth-best attempt differential on the team, third-best among forwards. The numbers look even better after lnStat accounts for shot quality, using an expected goals metric that accounts for the frequency and location of shots. Wisconsin left with a plus-four xG differential with Holloway on the ice. Not bad for an18-year-old. He's just got such phenomenal, mature habits. Holloway never flies the zone, consistently applies back-pressure on rush defence, pickpockets puck-carriers, makes timely hits, wields a disruptive stick - - you name it. It's everything one wants from a checking centre. The list of plaudits to Holloway's game on the other side of the puck is considerably shorter. He's not a pure sniper, and that's not likely to ever change. Holloway relies mostly on off the puck movements to generate his offence, lacking the puck skills to beat a defender in 1-on-1 situations or to get through heavy traffic. Interestingly, we've identified Holloway's eye-hand coordination as a strength though based on his ability to make contact on deflections. He's willing to take a beating to get to the spots where those deflections prove most threatening, too. There are some interesting quirks to his approach, certainly; a basis on which Holloway can build. He's a manipulative puck-carrier, one who works within the defensive feet-to-stick triangle at different speeds, a capable east-west attacker, and one who shields the puck from opposing defenders really, really well. Holloway also possesses a good read on pressure, and seems to know precisely when to dispatch of the puck. Even if he's not pulling spin-o-rama passing plays; it's comforting to know that he'II rarely cost his team possession of the puck in the offensive zone. Live to fight another day, etc. You're never going to see Holloway's name atop a scoring leaderboard. It's just not going to happen. I'm not even sure it's something worth positing as a possibility in the NCAA much less the NHL. The more likely outcome is that Holloway continues to grow offensively in a more prominent role in Wisconsin while all the while continuing to shut it down defensively. He's the type of versatile, Swiss Army knife-type of forward every coach would love to have in their middle-six. At least, Holloway has a real chance at being that at the NHL level. "
Helge Grans,"We've shed a lot of digital ink on players starting the scouting season with a bang. Today, we're going to break from that theme, as Malmo Redhawks defender Helge Grans absolutely does not qualify. Let's call a spade a spade - - Grans was awful at the 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup. No two scouts see the same thing on any given play but everyone agrees that this tournament was burn-the-tape bad for the young Swede. Everything that could go wrong for Grans did. He played five games in a top-four role for the Swedes and in both phases of special teams. For his trouble? Grans finished with one assist, a minus-three rating, and the opposition out-attempted Sweden 70-48 when he was on the ice. If first impressions count for a lot, then it's no surprise that Grans' stock still hasn't recovered in the public sphere. Here's what I can tell you about the team side; I've spoken to at least two clubs that rate Grans in the teens. It's everything Grans did after that ignominious start to the scouting season that won them over. He went back to the) 20 SuperElit and produced at a point per game pace on a middling Redhawks side, good for the second-highest points per game rate on the team. Even though Grans' consistent, productive brand of hockey earned him regular promotions to the SHL; he's still fifth on the Redhawks in scoring and fifth in defensive scoring in the SuperElit, first in points per game. That's about the point when Grans' game blossomed - - when he joined the Redhawks' SHL team. It sounds crazy - - we certainly don't agree with this analysis, as a disclaimer - - but there were voices in Sweden comparing Grans' game to that of Rasmus Dahlin. Was Grans that good in the SHL? Absolutely not. Was he good enough that he warranted such praise? Also, absolutely not. When one evaluates Grans' game on its own terms, though. there's a lot to like. Everything flows from his skating ability. This 6-foot-3 Swede effortlessly covers massive swaths of ice, and what he can't get to with his feet he can more than account for with his seemingly endless reach. Our Dir. of European Scouting, Christoffer Hedlund, identified a smoothness to Grans' and effortless four-way mobility as the defining characteristics of his skating. This, of course, allows Grans to smoothly cover either blue line. He'll walk the offensive blue line with the puck on his stick with relative ease; and he can mitigate risk while maintaining an aggressive, space consuming posture when defending the defensive blue line. In general, Grans is one of the better 1-on-1defenders in this class. It's simple. He skates well, has a long reach, an active stick, and good habits with his footwork. There isn't much more one would want from a defender in large-ice scenarios. Really, he's a fine defender in most scenarios, contrary to popular belief. Grans makes good reads off of the puck - - even if he's liable to get caught puck-watching on the odd occasion --  maintains an appropriate work rate, is becoming increasingly physical, and makes smart decisions with the puck once he's dispossessed the opposition. The only real concern that Hedlund identified in his player report, and often in game reports, is a lack of confidence on Grans' part. It's something we've discussed regularly in our meeting. At the expense of sounding like we're describing basically every Aaron Sorkin protagonist; we're just not sure that Grans has any idea how good or how physically gifted he is. It's a limiting factor in the offensive zone, too. Grans doesn't stray from the offensive blue line with the puck on his stick, and he doesn't try anything all that creative. There's also just a tendency to hesitate on plays where a surer hand could do some real damage. This reminds Hedlund of another prospect that's flourished since their draft-year in New York Rangers 2018 first-round pick Nils Lundkvist. Once Lundkvist became more confident in his abilities, things started to really turn for the better. Hedlund anticipates that Grans could chart a similar course. ""There is a ton of stuff Grans already does well,"" Hedlund noted. ""I believe that many of his flaws are either stuff he can correct or notably improve upon or stuff that will get better with age and experience."" ""When I look at him defend, I feel like so many of his problems are tied to his insecurities which then leads to hesitation or poor decisions. If he could find more confidence, I believe that he has the tools to become a good defensive player. With more experience and added strength I think Grans will take major steps in his defensive play. He looks a lot like Nils Lundkvist did in his draft year, and even the year after that - - they had many of the same issues."" There are inherent flaws, and then there are developmental flaws. Most of what we see with Grans fall in the latter camp, and those can be corrected. That leaves Grans with a good shot of developing into a top-four defenceman who can chip in on the second unit in both phases of special teams. He'll bring a ton of value in transition, too. "
Kaiden Guhle,"The year-over-year progress from Kaiden Guhle's draft-minus-one season to his first-year of draft-eligibility was stark, and he announced as much from the start of the scouting season. I could hardly believe the Guhle I was watching patrol the blue line for Team Canada at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup. He was aggressive, physical, decisive, and quick on his feet. There were some nights where Guhle outplayed Jamie Drysdale even. And in the games where he didn't; Guhle was always full-value from an entertainment perspective. ""Our guys have been super impressed with Guhle,"" one front office staffer told me via text during the Hlinka-Gretzky. ""I thought he was fucking awful last year, but I might have to circle back here."" It's good to know I wasn't the only one that noticed. That was just the amuse-bouche for a spectacular draft-year on Guhle's part, one which saw him rise from a likely second-round prospect to a surefire first-rounder. The first thing anyone notices with Guhle is what a powerful, graceful skater he is. It's something that Mitch Brown accounted for in his player report on the Prince Albert Raiders blue liner. ""Guhle boasts two-step acceleration and separation: strings together fully extended crossovers and strides continuously: fully torsioned cuts and turns allows for close-quarters separation; explosive in open ice."" It must run in the family. Brendan Guhle, Kaiden's older brother and an Anaheim Ducks defenceman, has always had that part of the game down pat. That's about where the similarities between the two end though. Kaiden is a much more forceful player, one fully capable of taking over a game at any given moment. It's rare, but something I've seen enough times to trust. I've seen him construct an end-to-end rush - - live, no less - - to seal a Prince Albert win in overtime against the Edmonton Oil Kings; I've also seen him singlehandedly end an opposition cycle and execute the breakout on more times than I can remember. He's physically imposing in the most literal sense. To hear Brown describe it, ""Guhle is an absolute menace when he's on. He punishes straight-line rushes along the boards with regularity; closes out shots/passes with speed."" It's that last line that really sticks out. Many defenders at this age stop moving their feet whenever they close on their opponent, particularly in open-ice scenarios. That's not the case at all with Guhle. He's constantly moving his feet, closing through challenges, closing on his opponent as the puck lands on his stick, closing on his opponent as they're going through their shot.  He's also the best transition defender this side of Jake Sanderson. Guhle closes with such speed and force, regularly dispossessing his opponent of the puck right at the defensive blue line, and making it look easy in the process. As one might suspect at this point, Guhle is a one-man breakout. It all starts with strong habits on defensive zone puck retrievals. He identifies pressures, selects his escape route, and sells deception upon collecting the puck, and seamlessly transitions up-ice. That's when Guhle's limitations start to reveal themselves though - - once he's entered the offensive zone. The fact remains that his puck skills just do not rate highly, not in this class, not among WHL defenders, or in any capacity, really. He struggles to corral difficult passes, has a tendency to lead with the puck, keeps his hands and feet on the same beat, and tends to fumble the puck a fair bit. It's not like he has a booming point shot to lean back on either. Guhle does a good job of getting pucks through traffic and on-goal, but they're never especially threatening. He's not a particularly adept distributor either. Guhle regularly misses cross-ice opportunities and the variance in quality from one pass to the next is all over the place. Mostly, Guhle creates by activating off of the rush or joining the second-wave of the attack. That's where his strengths lie. The physical toolkit with Guhle really is as tantalizing as it gets. He's going to bring tremendous value to the NHL level in a top-four role playing difficult shutdown minutes, and should feature prominently on his team's penalty kill. He'll need to improve his decision-making - - that's still a problem - - and working on his puck skills couldn't hurt, but those are minor quibbles. There's a lot to like here."
Jacob Perreault,"Everyone knew about Sarnia Sting forward Jacob Perreault's shot and two-way credibility coming into this season. The 30 goals Perreault scored on a middling Sting team in his draft-minus-one season stand as his bona tides as a sniper. The plus-four goal differential at 5-on-5 is a nice feather in his cap asa difference-maker territorially, too. It's why his absence on the Canadian roster at 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia puzzled so many scouts - - they sure could've used his scoring punch in the Gold Medal Game. Whether Perreault used that snub as motivation or not - - who can say? There's no denying his hot start to the OHL season though, lighting the lamp twice on opening night enroute to six goals through his first ten games. That was just a sign of things to come. Perreault finished the year one short of the 40-goal mark, and added a handful of assists over last season in six fewer games. He's a pure sniper with one of the best shots in his entire draft class, as noted by the eight shooting grade that our OHL scout Rachel Doerrie meted to the Sarnia product. This segment from a player report Doerrie wrote in November does a good job of detailing the extent of his arsenal. ""Perreault has one of the best shots in this draft class. It's accurate, hard and he can score from anywhere. He can score from both sides off of the rush, one-timers, quick shots off of faceoffs, and off of rebounds in front of the net. His nose for the net and quick hands in tight make him a threat from anywhere in the offensive zone. His ability to catch and shoot pucks in stride when the passes aren't in the wheelhouse is a transferable skill that will serve him well."" The backhand shot - - a long lost art-form - - is just another feather in PerreauIt's game and one he uses to catch goaltenders off guard from time-to-time. My personal favourite is when he drops the shoulder as if to give the appearance of protecting the puck, only to let a backhand shot off right as the goaltender's let their guard down. Even if there wasn't a massive jump in assists: we've identified Perreault's playmaking as an area of growth this season. ""His distribution skills have improved,"" Doerrie remarked. ""He's making the players around him better because of the scoring chances he's creating."" Still, there is room for growth. ""He can control defenders, but sometimes misses slot-cutting teammates or better positioned ones on the flank as he tries to dangle too many defenders,"" David St-Louis remarked in a game report. ""He could also become guilty of forcing passes at the next level as defenders better anticipate what he wilI do next."" There's some debate over how to rate Perreault's skating though. That's less clear to our staff. There are mechanical inconsistencies in the way he covers the ice, particularly in the stutters that often arise in his crossovers. His stride recovery lands a bit high and wide, limiting his acceleration in space. Even so, Perreault achieves the desirable flexion at all three points, and he's got a great deal of lower-body strength. too. I've seen Perreault accelerate as if shot from a cannon and just explode up-ice at a breakneck pace. I haven't seen it often, but I've definitely seen it. There weren't many strong puck-carriers on Sarnia - - Ryan McGregor had moments, I guess? That meant that Perreault took on a massive burden in transition, and he handled it with aplomb. The numbers that Mitch Brown collected from the CHL+USNTDP U18 team this season place Perreault in the top-quartile for all three of the entry statistics his project accounts for - - controlled entries per hour, controlled entries relative percentage, and successful controlled entries relative percentage. It's fair to wonder how much of his production can be attributed to playing on a Sting team that absolutely, undeniably played a system that was perfectly suited to his style - - or the absence of a system, depending on your mileage. Doesn't just about every prospect come with their own contextual question marks though? Perreault's pathway to improvement as a skater is pretty straightforward. Everything else, and his shot especially, is at a relatively high level. He has all the makings of a top-six scorer if he continues to develop at this rate."
Noel Gunler,"The variance in opinions on Lulea winger Noel Gunler is about as vast as Sweden's territorial holdings in 1658, with career outcomes ranging in fortune from The Battle of Narva to the Treaty of Stockholm. For the non-history nerds among us, the more dour of those two outcomes, the Treaty of Stockholm, is a Swedish capitulation to the coalition forces they faced in the Great Northern War, in which they surrendered many of their territorial holdings on mainland Europe, particularly in Pomerania. Basically, they lost their willingness to fight, and that's the first item many scouts cite as a strike against Gunler. He's not ceding territory in the literal sense but possession of the puck is another matter, or so the narrative goes. I mean. how else does one explain the esteem or lack thereof in which the scouting community holds Gunler? Never mind the Swedish Federation's unwillingness to use him in any capacity this year. This is a player that stringed together 15 relatively productive games in the SHL during his draft-minus-one season; one who followed it up with a 13 points in 45 games this year with Lulea's men's team. There's no denying his offensive gifts. Gunler plays with such finesse, such anticipation. Where most cleave through their opponents with the precision of a chainsaw while they're forechecking, Gunler picks his opponents apart as if by scalpel. He'll hover above the puck and pick off passes if he's the first man in or he'll wield his stick like a Hungry Hungry Hippo from just outside the scrum in support of his teammates as the F2 and leave with possession. He's not afraid of initiating contact, by any means, but it's nothis go-to. Which brings us to one of his shortcomings -- an unwillingness to take a hit. It's a consistent theme throughout game reports. Gunler just doesn't hang in there under even modest physical duress. On the odd occasion when tries to, it's more cute than it is resilient. ""Gunler sometimes seems stressed when he is about to get hit and throws the puck away. Clearly, it affects his decision-making negatively,"" our Dir. of European Scouting Christoffer Hedlund said of Gunler in a Player Report from this season. ""He needs to become stronger on the puck when chaIlenged by direct physical play."" It should come as no surprise then that Gunler creates the majority of his offence with off the puck skating patterns, the ability to find space, and relatively good timing. He's got a great shot, and if someone can carry the puck into the offensive zone or dig it out on retrievals for him - - watch out. The curl-and-release is a favourite of Gunler's, but that also speaks to his limitations as a sniper. He's not a true one-touch scorer - - the stick isn't supposed to travel against the grain of the puck if you want that label - - and generally struggles to generate power in small-ice scenarios. One of the real strengths of Gunler as a shooter is his shot placement. He's able to tag anywhere on net with time and space. If he integrated a little more deception into his release or wielded pre-shot movement to get the goalie going, he'd really be cooking with fire. If he improved as a skater, too? Now we're really talking. It's not like it can get much worse. He's got such a wide stride when he jumps from his stance, with a recovery that lands well outside his frame, and an unwillingness or inability to integrate crossovers in space. ""His skating is ugly and he's not quick, especially in small-area situations - - wide recovery, lack of consistent extensions, and for some reason, he never uses crossovers in open ice,"" Mitch Brown remarked in a game report. ""You'd think a player with such a flaw open-ice stride and obvious speed limitations would rely more on crossovers. Not only will crossovers allow him to get more out of his hands, it'll provide more efficient acceleration/speed generation."" That he can't handle the puck at the meagre speed he's generating at this stage in his development is just a little bit concerning. He'll occasionaIly place the puck within the defensive triangle, and there are flashes of genuine ski11, but it's hardly what we'd consider a strength. In the defensive zone, GunIer is just a complete adventure. He's either completely checked out or just a little too invested. He attacks the puck-carrier in a straight line, consistently overcommits, and is easily taken out of the play. The commonality across ever Gunler performance, good and bad alike, is that he's not providing much if any value from his own zone. Whichever team drafts Gunler isn't going to be looking for the next Frank J. Selke trophy candidate though. They're drafting him to score goals, and there's ample evidence that he can perform that task at an absurdly high level given his age. It's hard to imagine a scenario where Gunler makes us look good with this ranking. He'll either explode into a top-six scoring role with utility on an NHL power play or have an illustrious European career. It's hard to imagine just about anything else. He's one of the draft's most fascinating players. "
Thomas Bordeleau,"We're really breaking from the pack with our next ranked prospect, United States National Team Development Program U18 centre Thomas Bordeleau. The consolidated rankings on the EliteProspects 'Draft Center' page don't even place Bordeleau in the first-round based on the average of the public outlets that pour into it. Here we are, comfortable with him at No. 23. It's simple, really. Our American scout, Joey Padmanabhan, has been in Bordeleau's corner all year. He's not the only one. It was clear from the USHL Fall Classic Just how much the coaching staff trusted the sturdy, short pivot, committed to the University of Michigan for the 2020-21 season... assuming there is one. USNTDP head coach Seth Appert had Bordeleau taking just about every defensive zone faceoff, playing against the opposition's best lines, and leading the first unit penalty kill. It was the start of a trend that saw Bordeleau finish second in defensive zone faceoffs on the program, only one behind the leader Chase Yoder. t's one thing to endure tough deployments; it's another entirely to thrive in them. Bordeleau finds himself comfortably in the latter camp. The data that lnStat accumulated from the NTDP's season shows Bordeleau winning 55 percent of his challenges, easily the highest rate among the team's forwards. Perhaps most impressive of alI is the territorial domination that The Program enjoyed with Bordeleau on the ice. His+171 shot attempt differential is 50 attempts clear of the next highest skater on his team; this, in spite of gruelling minutes. ""Bordeleau is a tenacious defender who manages to force opponents' hands without over-pursuing,"" Padmanabhan said in a player report from this season. He's also in the top quartile for the three defensive statistics that our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown tracks during CHL and USNTDP viewings. He's particularly adept at breaking up plays in the defensive zone. Granted, it wasn't Bordeleau's quality as a two-way piece that Padmanabhan had to sell us on in our scouting meetings. There was no denying that much. The question we had to repeatedly ask was: How much offensive upside does Bordeleau bring to the table? Is it commensurate with a first-round grade? We value upside heavily, and it took a little bit of convincing. Ultimately, it meant a lot to us that Padmanabhan remained steadfast in his belief that Bordeleau possessed untapped offensive potential. ""As his strength improves, Bourdeau could prove to be an NHL-calibre player with a very high ceiling,"" Padmanabhan remarked in a Player Report from earlier this season. What do most high-ceiling players share in common? An innate, unteachable quality -- hockey sense. Whatever one's definition of that most nebulous of traits; it's one that Bordeleau brings in spades. His anticipation of developing plays is at such a uniquely high level for players in this age group. There are games where it just seems like the puck is following Bordeleau and vice versa. The puck is the Ring of Power, and Bordeleau is Sauron - - it wants to get back to its master. He's at his absolute best carrying the puck on the perimeter. scanning the defence. waiting for a passing opportunity to open up and striking with extreme precision to a waiting teammate. His puck protection habits are so strong for a player his size, and that's something he'll need to take with him to the NCAA level, then, perhaps, the NHL if everything breaks right. ""While clocking in at just 5-foot-9, Bordeleau uses exceptional speed, and puck protection habits to make an impact in the offensive zone despite his size."" Padmanabhan continued, ""he's incredibly effective around the perimeter, shifting his weight to better protect the puck for larger opponents and creating seams for passes and shots. When Bordeleau does expose the puck, it's to manipulate defenders' gaps and reach, which he then exploits with his powerful and efficient skating stride."" When Bordeleau baits a defenceman, it's straight to the centre lane and into the homeplate area that we commonly associate with scoring chances. That helps explain how this pint-sized centre led the NTDP in individual expected goals. according to lnStat, with over 11 such tallies. It's going to be hard for some to square Bordeleau's solid if unspectacular production with a first-round grade. We get it. We'd also ask that one consider the environment in which he played. It wasn't just a down year for the NTDP as the whole: it was a spectacularly poor group at forward, in particular. We're not sure that Bordeleau ever had the support necessarily to flourish offensively, and frankly, his point production, however meek at first glance, might actually be to his credit. He's smart. He's such a refined two-way player. His puck skills and the habits with which he handles are both at a high level. There's a lot to like. It's why we've rated Thomas Bordeleau higher than most. "
John-Jason Peterka,"Everyone was talking about Tim Stutzle after the U20 World Hockey Championships, but what about his German linemate John-Jason Peterka? He was the best of the three high-profile Germans on that first-line, a take that is surprisingly controversial, in spite of Peterka leading the group with six points (four goals and two assists). Now, if the ranking didn't make as much clear, allow me to state, for posterity, that no one on our staff rates Peterka higher than Stutzle. We just found ourselves a little perplexed by the lack of press for the EHC Munchen product's performance relative to his linemate. Well, we took notice. That was the turning of the worm, as the saying goes. It was that moment that really caught our attention; the moment that made clear we needed to do even more homework on this kid. He plays the game with such force. Peterka doubtless has the highest motor in this class, and I'm not even sure I'd consider anyone a serious contender. He's hard on every puck. He's an eager, willing combatant in board battles. He's violent, disruptive - - a real pain in the ass. ""His unrelenting motor is a force multiplier in every zone,"" J.D. Burke remarked in a March game report. ""He'll make second and third efforts where other players generally relent."" ""Another game where Peterka's motor never waved and his defensive prowess stood out,"" Mitch Brown offered in a February report. ""He constantly applied pressure on the puck carrier, deterred shots, and fought for possession. He's so effective supporting plays and reading opportunities to pounce on the backcheck."" Of course, will alone isn't going to land anyone an A-grade. Not in our books. There has to be a skill component, too. Fret not, because it's something we've noted in Peterka's game. He's an especially threatening player off of the puck. His sense of timing is at such a high level for a player his age. It's one thing to identify passing lanes; it's another to create passing lanes with off the puck movement and deception; it's yet another thing to time one's sprints to these spaces perfectly to become an option for the puck-carrier. It's just one of the many ways that Peterka consistently supports the puck, a theme that carries through all three zones of the ice. He's constantly involved in the play. He's rarely if ever stationary, constantly scanning the ice when the puck isn't on his stick, flaring wide and blending interior movements, adjusting pace, etc. It's really advanced stuff. Things get a lot more rudimentary once the puck is on Peterka's stick. It's not that he doesn't have puck skiIIs - - he absolutely does. It's that his inability to change speeds and the infrequency with which he handles the puck within the defensive triangle makes him vulnerable in open ice scenarios. Here is how Brown described Peterka's shortcomings as a distributor of the puck. ""Peterka doesn't look before passing. He frequently relies on a look-off without looking first, missing a chance to set-up a scoring chance. He often fails to spot the trailer; he drops head on the backhand. That said, he is a technically skilled passer on the backhand and forehand. "" Now about that tempo; the one tempo at which Peterka plays. He's a powerful skater, one with a mostly refined mechanical base. His knee-bend is great, allowing him to get low and generate a tonne of power on his full extensions. Furthermore, Peterka maintains a relatively rigid torso, allowing for the retention of momentum. The only real quibbles we have with Peterka's skating is that he collapses just a bit hard at the hips, making him a little bit top-heavy and vulnerable to physical contact as a result. He also has a tendency to wave his arms like a Whacky Inflatable Tube Arm Man, and it'd be nice if he could bring them in a bit. Peterka does a good job of weaponizing his advanced skating in open space, too. He avails himself of a wide variety of rush patterns, integrates the dotted line, and has the ability to maintain stride through passes, pass receipts, etc. He also handles outside-in, where others go inside-out. There is just so much to like about this player's game, even if some of the technical aspects are a little unrefined. The skill level is there for Peterka to develop into a reliable, two-way forward capable of playing in a team's top-nine and in both phases of special teams. "
Connor Zary,"The scouting community's collective dossier on Kamloops Blazers centre Connor Zary is exceptionally long. He's already finished his third WHL season, and if that wasn't enough, he featured prominently on Canada's roster at the 2019 U18 World Hockey Championships as a draft-minus-one skater. We've certainly thought a lot about this player, too. He's probably one of the more low-key divisive players in this year's draft, if you'll permit me that colloquialism. I've talked to scouts who rate Zary as a bona fide top-15 pick without even a shred of doubt; I've also spoken to one who rates him as a second-round prospect. Connor Zary: It's a land of contrasts. We're right in the middle of those two extremes: think of it as Horseshoe Theory, but with a different application and actually real in this case. There's no denying his production. Zary finished fifth in WHL scoring with 86 points (38 goals and 48 assists) in 57 games as a first-time draft-eligible skater. Mitch Brown, who is based in Western Canada, summed it up nicely in an article he wrote for EliteProspects Rinkside in August. ""What do Nolan Patrick, Mat Barzal, and Cody Glass have in common? Zary outscored each and every one of them in their draft years Only six WHLers in the past decade recorded a higher point-per-game in their draft year than Zary did, fellow 2020NHL Draft-eligible Seth Jarvis among them."" Not bad, right? It's Zary's shot that leads the way. He's a deceptive triggerman, one with excellent shot placement. a deceptive release. and the ability to fire two-touch missiles on a moment's notice. ""He's a downright clever shooter, picking spots all over the net: he uses unique placement, shooting low and against the grain with frequency."" Brown continued, ""he has the skill to adjust through his shot; easily shots through defensive pressure because feet are always ready to drop into weight shift; variety: wrist, two-touch. catch-and-release, snap."" There's a healthy volume of shots coming off his stick, too. According to Pick224.com, Zary averaged 4.51 shots per game, the third-highest rate in the WHL. Those shots were most threatening off the rush, which is a surprising quirk considering the dearth of transitional value that Zary brought to the table last season - - Brown's data has Zary in the14th percentile among his sample in controlled entries per hour at 5-on-5. They don't often occur with Zary as the primary puck-carrier. He's more comfortable supporting the transition up-ice, finding pockets of space, and offering himself as a trailer. From there, Zary does his best to move goaltenders east-west, deploy screens using opposing defenders, shoots through legs, sticks, etc. His ability to collect difficult passes is a real difference-maker in many of these situations. Zary can corral passes with a nearly 360-degree radius, and he does an excellent job of transferring the puck with a soft touch directly into his wheelhouse. He doesn't often break stride to receive passes either, maintaining the pace of his team's attack. ""Unlike most junior players, Zary lets passes come across his body before catching them, allowing him to step directly into his weight shift for the shot,"" Brown wrote in his profile of Zary. ""Most junior players catch the puck in the centre of their bodies, adding an extra step into the catch-and-shoot process. That extra step - however little time it takes - is all defenders need to pressure the shot, if not erase it."" The reason Zary can't or doesn't really contribute much in transition is that his skating profile just doesn't allow for it. It's not outright awful. There are even rare occasions in which Zary's skating looks passable. But even in those spots, there are mechanical inconsistencies that hinder his progress up-ice. It starts with the way that Zary collapses at his hips, tilting forward, and causing him to dig with his toes. As a result, he tends to out-toe, which limits the amount of blade-to-ice contact, therefore suppressing the power generated through each stride. There's also a little bit of inefficiency and wasted motion through Zary's stride when he kicks his heels up, having to then level them before the next extension. Another area where Zary is fairly limited is as a distributor. He's prone to overhandling the puck, missing opportunities to create scoring chances through his linemates. Even in more static situations, Zary hasn't consistently displayed the ability to find teammates through traffic, much less execute on highly difficult passes. So, when considering Zary's strengths and weaknesses, we find ourselves leaning towards an NHL future spent on the wing. We see Zary as being skilled enough to contribute as a triggerman in the middle-six, playing the wing, and bringing his high defensive work rate to one fortunate team's penalty kill. "
Jeremie Poirier,"The next subject of our draft guide, Saint John Sea Dogs ""defenceman"" Jeremie Poirier, might have proven the single most difficult player evaluation we faced all season. Everything looked so promising for the former eighth-overall pick in the OMJHL Draft. Poirier exploded onto the scene with an electric, dominant performance for Canada at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup, with three points to show for his five games in Breclav. He got off to a pretty hot start in Saint John, too. It was a nice encore, and we hoped, a sign of things to come. That was very much so not the case. Quite the opposite was true. Each of our North American scouts - - alI of which had the opportunity to do crossover scouting with the extra time aIlotted us - - agreed that Poirier’s play rapidly deteriorated over the course of the season. ""Watching Poirier play is depressing,"" our OMJHL scout David St-Louis noted in a March game report. ""He's a shell of the dominant. controlled offensive player he was in some games early in the season. Now, he's alI about doing everything himself. He lost trust in his teammates and what little interest he ever had playing defence. ""It wasn't significantly better in the first half, but at least he tried to get back on defence and his aggressiveness lead to him breaking plays in between blue-lines. Now, it's just a mess. Poirier is completely disinterested."" There were games in February and early March in which Poirier had to ride pine, stapled there by a frustrated coaching staff. Do you know how poorly one has to perform to earn in-game disciplinary measures on that team? I mean, they let William Villeneuve play. In all seriousness though, the Sea Dogs finished 11th in the 'O, surrendering 280 goals, the most of any team in that league. As one might suspect given this preamble, and Poirier's gaudy statistical profile; it's the defensive side of the game where problems arise. So many problems. So, so many damned problems. It all starts in the neutral zone. Poirier is a poor backwards skater and he covers for this by launching himself like a Tomahawk missile at the puck-carrier as soon as they've crossed the blue line into the neutral zone. It's an extremely risky maneuver made worse by his decision to often attack in a straight line, leaving him an easily avoidable obstacle with even a minor shimmy in either direction. ''He's aggressive to a fault through the neutral zone, launching himself at opponents in a straight line and leaving his partner to clean up the resulting 2-on-1s,"" J.D. Burke noted in a March contest. ""This might prove effective if Poirier could skate at a high-level, but he can't. Here is what St-Louis wrote about Poirier's skating stride in an excellent article on how the 18-year-old rearguard from Salaberry-de-Valleyfield covers ice. ""Poirier is agile, but his lack of knee flexion. short stride, and the way he lands on his inside edges on stride recovery limit his explosiveness and speed. Although he makes good use of crossovers in his puck rushes, improving the form of his forward and backward strides could further help him gain a step on opponents."" Now, the main thrust of that article by St-Louis was to show how Poirier generates immense transitional value, cross-referencing the film, and the data that Mitch Brown collected from his season. How does that data look at final count? Pretty damn good. Poirier is in the 96thpercentile for his controlled entry success rate relative to his team, and in the 86th percentile for generating controlled entries at 5-on-5. He uses the boards, teammates, and deception to create breakouts with relative ease. While carrying the puck through the neutral zone, Poirier wields the dotted line to shift defenders from his path, and then attacks on an arc as he transitions play into the offensive zone. There are two different ways that Poirier creates offence once he's established in-zone possessions on transition plays. His preferred method is to drag the defensive front and distribute into the slot as his teammates sneak into prime scoring opportunities. He's a pretty crafty stickhandler too though and can occasionally take the puck into high-danger areas himself. The vast majority of his offence came from in-zone plays though, the types that occur during cycles or immediately after won face-offs. He's an opportunistic point-man, jumping into the play when the situation is right. Some of his best work occurs when he's operating from high in the offensive third though. From there, Poirier scans the entire offensive zone, sends false signals to the defenders nearest him, and executes difficult high-to-low or cross-ice passes to place his teammates in prime scoring situations. His creativity with the puck on his stick, his vision, his execution - - they're all at an elite level. It's no fluke that Poirier put up 53 points on one of the OMJHL's worst squads. Here's the thing - - Poirier is a top-five playmaker in this draft class. Not for defencemen. He's a top-five playmaker in this draft class period. ""Poirier looks like a potential top-pairing defender with 50-plus points scoring upside,"" Brown said in an October game report. There are worthwhile questions about Poirier's defensive reads, work rate, skating ability, and whether he'll elevate them to the level necessary to take regular shifts in the NHL. He's the ultimate high-risk, high-reward player in this year's draft. "
Theodor Niederbach,"You probably hadn't heard much if anything about Frolunda HC centre Theodor Niederbach coming into this season. Unless, of course, you travelled in Swedish scouting circles - - they knew. That's what a lost season does to a player; it takes them off the map entirely. This was supposed to be Niederbach's second year in Frolunda. Instead, this was his first, as the Bjasta, Sweden product went under the knife ahead of the 2018-19 season, and never had a chance to hit the ice as a draft-minus-one skater. Then, somehow, he didn't skip a beat as he made his J20 SuperElit debut for Frolunda in October. That's after missing an entire year of development while recovering from knee surgery. Oh, and if that weren't enough, Niederbach basically skipped three levels of hockey, going straight from the U16 Elit to a regular spot in a J20 lineup. That alone would be, in the immortal words of one Larry David, ""pretty, pretty, pretty good."" That Niederbach went on to lead his team in points and finished third among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the J20 SuperElit is pretty fantastic. Just imagine where Niederbach's game might be had he not lost anentire season.. Another worthwhile question is how much more Niederbach might've produced in better circumstances. Many of our game reports from earlier in the season cite Niederbach as playing on the third-line at 5-on-5, sometimes on the right wing. The data that lnStat collected from Frolunda's season shows Niederbach eighth among forwards in ice-time at 14:53 a game, too. By the end of the season, though, Niederbach had ascended to the top of Frolunda's lineup as the centrepiece on one of the SuperElit's deadliest duos with fellow A-grade prospect Daniel Torgersson. It's Niederbach's awareness and vision in the offensive zone that our Dir. of European Scouting, Christoffer Hedlund, has identified as the basis for so much of his offensive output. He maintains a detailed mental map of the ice that allows for quick decisions under duress and a heightened read on incoming pressure. ""Much of Niederbach's game revolves around his smartness and ability to process the game and what is happening around him,"" Hedlund noted in a game report from October. ""He could make nifty, seemingly minor plays quickly to open up the ice for his teammates, and he could spot passing lanes before receiving the puck, which enabled him to adapt to the high pace environment despite not being the fastest player out there."" His office of choice in the offensive zone tends to be on the left side of the ice, below the face-off circle, and preferably from below the goal line when his team has the man advantage. This allows him to scan virtually the entirety of the offensive zone any time that the puck is on his stick. Off of the puck, Niederbach tends to skate into the slot, keeping his feet moving, processing the movements of the nearest defenders, and waiting for a chance to pounce on any opening they might present. That has to be the case for Niederbach to hit pay-dirt and find the scoresheet himself. He's got a quick release on his wrist shot, and it's fairly accurate, too. The lack of power and only above-average placement means that he can only threaten from short-to-intermediate range though. Similarly, Niederbach only shows as an above-average skater, if only barely, at this stage in his career. That last qualifier is an important one given the time he lost and the physical limitations incurred over that crucial developmental year. The mechanics in his stride are mostly sound. As Mitch Brown noted in a January game report, Niederbach skates with ""a wide recovery and angling of the toes at the beginning of the extension, but he generates more speed than his stride might suggest. He integrates crossovers for smooth acceleration, and uses them while in possession to transmit false information and build speed."" The pathway to improvement here is relatively straightforward: Maintain better discipline during stride recovery, and most important of all, continue to build lower-body strength. We've faced a lot of push back from scouts on the team side for where we've ranked Niederbach. Much of it stems from the belief that he's most effective in the defensive third of the ice, and therefore doesn't represent much of an upside play. There's an element of truth to that assessment. Well, the part about his defensive value anyway. Niederbach runs with a high motor, consistently tracking well through the neutral zone, and applying back-pressure on every opposing rush. He's a sound in-zone defender, with his head on a swivel, anticipating plays before they develop, and taking the routes necessary to intercept opposition passes in flight. His best habit defensively is that he maintains an above-the-puck posture and suffocates opposition puck-carriers. Off of the puck, he's so dialled in, capable of making the right reads and knowing when he can switch from his man and give his teammate support. We find it fascinating that there's been so much pushback from scouts and front office executives on the team side. They're downlight incredulous, right across the board, with this one. It sort of feels like we're being gaslit; as if they're trying to throw us off the scent. The player that we see when we watch Niederbach brings a lot to the table. He's a credible two-way piece that can skate at an above-average level and distribute the puck better than anyone outside the top-three Swedish forwards in this class, and he has the statistical track record to prove it. We're not projecting Niederbach to an NHL first-line, but something like a productive career in a middle-six role with utility in both phases of special teams seems wholly attainable."
Ryan O'Rourke,"Every NHL lineup needs a handful of good soldiers; not everyone can play the role of the hero. For two long years, Ryan O'Rourke dug-in with his spade for the Soo, and left wave upon wave of offensive attacks relatively unscathed. Every time the opposition sent out their first-line or they pulled the goalie or there was a crucial defensive zone draw - - O'Rourke was first over the boards, sent to repel the invaders, like a one-man Mannerheim Line ironically draped in red. It wasn't easy. It wasn't glamorous. It doesn't often show up on the scoresheet. It's what the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds needed from O'Rourke, though, and he happily obliged. When O'Rourke was on the ice, the Greyhounds outscored the opposition by a 69-57 margin at even strength, according to Pick224.com; when he was on the bench, the opposition outscored the Greyhounds 94-81atevens. That's the sort of on-ice goal-driving impact that earned O'Rourke the highest estimated even strength ice-time in the OHL among first-time draft-eligible skaters, according to the estimates collected by Pick224. Our partners at lnStat Hockey have O'Rourke down for 24:40 a game in all-situations, second only to Jacob LaGuerriere on the Greyhounds. Another interesting bit of data? lnStat has the Greyhounds running a plus-93 shot attempt differential, second only to Jaromir Pytlik. It all starts with a stout posture in the neutral zone. O'Rourke isn't an aggressive transitional defender in the mold of Kaiden Guhle, opting instead for a more composed, diabolical approach; one that baits the puck-carrier with open space and then closes with thunderous force. Here's how Mitch Brown, our Dir. of North American Scouting, described O'Rourke's neutral zone defence. in a player report from about the mid-season mark; he's also responsible for the above-posted chart. ""While a tad passive through the neutral zone, he closes quickly on the defensive blue line. He shows switch-ability and awareness to thwart odd-man situations, mitigates risk with footwork, makes almost zero committing mistakes, and follows an active, middle-protecting pattern with his stick along with a heavy shoulder."" He's every bit as responsible an in-zone defender. O'Rourke maintains a detailed read of the ice, with his head on a swivel, constantly eliminating with his stick or plus-positioning the nearest forward. He just consumes options as soon as they emerge for the opposition puck-carrier. On the puck, O'Rourke is mean, nasty, violent - - everything one wants from a durable, robust stay-at-home defender. He closes through puck movements, whether it's a pass or a shot, and keeps his feet moving through stick challenges. His battle-level is just so unbelievably high. He never takes a moment off, never mind a shift, and much less an entire game. If there's a threat within his reach; O'Rourke eliminates it with haste. Even something as simple as tying up a forward's stick ahead of a point shot - - that matters! O'Rourke is a capable puck-mover. too. He consistently makes good decisions with the puck and this much reveals itself in the data that Brown collected from the Greyhounds season. Brown's data shows O'Rourke in the 87th percentile for controlled exit success relative to his team. Don't expect any Bobby Orr-type end-to-end rushes out of O'Rourke - - that's just never been his game. He lacks two-step explosiveness, and he doesn't really achieve much acceleration over longer distances either. Foremost among his technical shortcomings as a skater is a heel kick; an inefficient, unnecessary expenditure of energy that takes away from his ability to recover quickly from his extensions. The other limiting factor as a puck-carrier is O'Rourke's handling. ""He's not a dexterous or diverse handler, and recognizes these limitations,"" Brown said in a player report from this season. ""He lacks pop as a passer, and is unable to find high-danger targets while inside the offensive zone."" To his credit, though, O'Rourke boasts an absolutely lethal slap shot. We just wish that he'd unleashed it more often this season - - it's a bona fide weapon. Ultimately. whichever team drafts O'Rourke is going to be exceedingly aware of these limitations. They're not drafting him to set the world on fire: they're trying to develop a modern, stay-at-home defensive defenceman in the Chris Tanev and Niklas Hjarlmarsson molds. "
Braden Schneider,"From one defensive defenceman to the next; our 29th-ranked prospect is Brandon Wheat Kings rearguard Braden Schneider. This punishing defender brings an impressive, lengthy resume to the table. Because he's a September birthdate - - Schneider is just five days removed from being eligible for the 2019 draft - - this year represented his third season in the WHL. The first thing anyone notices with Schneider is the NHL-ready frame that he boasts, standing tall over most of his WHL competition this year at 6-foot-2and209pounds. Only nine skaters boast a higher physical grade than the 7 that Mitch Brown meted to the Prince Albert native. Here is what Brown, our Dir. of North American Scouting, had to say about Schneider's physicality in a player report he authored in March. ""He is an absolute behemoth of a dude at this level, imposing his will with thunderous hits, overpowering one-hand pushes, and crosschecks. He's composed, and doesn't over-do the physicality or take needless penalties; enters every hit with his stick leading, and doesn't hit unless he can't break up the play otherwise."" It starts with strong defensive habits through the neutral zone. Schneider keeps play in front of him, never commits too early or overcommits, and does an excellent job of guiding the puck-carrier to the outside, leading with his stick, and moving his feet through each thunderous check. This approach can appear passive at times - - especially relative to the likes of a Kaiden Guhle, or worse still, Jeremie Poirier -- but it's a calculated gambit on Schneider's part. The Wheat Kings forwards don't offer the neutral zone support necessary for him to deploy a more aggressive posture. In the defensive zone, Schneider really turns it up another level - - it's easily the third of the ice where he's most comfortable. ""He's a switchable on/off-puck defender with help instincts and one-on-one skills,"" Brown said in his player report. He uses timed stick tie-ups against surrounding players, and is extremely vocal (it's not just evident from the press box, either)."" When Schneider is at the top of his game, he brings that one-man cycle-disrupting edge, singlehandedly ending offensive zone possession for the opposition. It's not something that shows up in every viewing but it's absolutely within his means. He's a rapacious fiend on defensive zone puck retrievals too, quickly activating on rebounds and leveraging himself between it and the nearest opposition forward. On dump-and-chase retrievals, Schneider quickly pivots, scans the defensive zone, plans his escape route, then quickly and decisively acts once the puck is on his stick. Now we're starting to step towards the part of Schneider's game that give us reasons for pause. Perhaps it's a sampling issue, but we're more concerned about his transition decision-making than most. This is particularly true on the backhand. where Schneider is a capable handler but tends to put himself and his teammates in trouble with ill-advised attempts through the middle of the ice. There's a reason that I qualified that bit of analysis by acknowledging the possibility of a sampling issue. This is always the case. Find me a scout - - particularly in the public sphere - - who professes to have seen every single one of a draft-eligible skater's games and you've found a liar. In this case, most of the scouts with which we've broached Schneider's game tend to think that this isn't much of an issue if one at all. Perhaps the sample of games we've seen isn't indicative of Schneider's true talent level or competence? Sampling variance is something one has to be wary of with any player but when the pushback to what one is seeing is this strong. it's worth mentioning. The sample of data that Brown collected from the Wheat Kings' season, 13 games worth, shows Schneider as generating a high volume of exits, but very few of those are possession-retaining relative to his teammates. Put another way: Schneider bears the brunt of his team's breakout burden but converts on very few of those attempts relative to his teammates. Those numbers pretty much drop across the board when it comes time for Schneider to take the puck across the offensive blue line. When his team has established offensive zone possession, Schneider really starts to take a backseat. He rates in the bottom-half of the CHL and USNTDP in expected goal generation, and his shot assists per hour are only in the 55th percentile - - even so, Schneider is in the 89th percentile generating expected assists, in fairness. ""Schneider lacks problem-solving skills on the point; he fails to recognize better options than the immediate one,"" Brown said in his player report. ""He's unable to adapt to changing circumstances despite plus-level tools."" There might be some untapped potential there. Schneider maintains close proximity to the offensive blue line, and doesn't often activate often off of the rush. These seem like relatively straightforward ways to create offensive value. He's got a quick release on his shot too, but we don't see it often enough for it to be a real threat. The long-term play for a team drafting Schneider is probably one centred on aiming for a robust second-pairing defenceman with two-way credibility mostly generated by his play in the defensive zone and on the penalty kill. "
Hendrix Lapierre,"We could have another five-to-ten meetings and not reach consensus as a group on where Chicoutimi Sagueneens centre Hendrix Lapierre belongs on our board. We try to approximate the NHL process through most of our work but this is one area where we break from our peers. This lack of consensus would oftentimes end with a player landing a 'DND' tag, short for 'do not draft.' That's a bridge too far. We decided it was best to not let perfect be the enemy of good and tried to best account for the give-and-take of Lapierre's game with a spot commensurate with whirlwind of variables that make up his season and long-term potential. Why has he proven such a divisive prospect in our ranks? Where to start? The former first-overall pick in the QMJHL draft didn't look like a threat for the first-round of the 2020 NHL Draft coming into this season. He looked like a bona fide top-ten pick by the end of the 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup - - it was a performance for the ages. ""Hendrix Lapierre has been one of Canada's best offensive players from puck drop to the final horn each of their three games thus far in the tournament,"" J.D. Burke remarked, reporting live from Bfeclav at the Hlinka. ""His pucks skills, and the ability to wield them with the same effectiveness at speed as he does at a standstill, make him a dazzling puck-carrier. He's going to do big things next year in the QMJHL if this tournament is any indication."" Extremely Ron Howard voice: He did not do big things; it was not an indication of things to come. Lapierre suffered three concussions in the midst of an incredibly trying season with the Sagueneens, and never recaptured that form at any point in the season, finishing with 17 points in 19 games. When I broached the tale of two seasons that made up Lapierre's draft-year with an Eastern Conference executive, he offered this. ""Look, I don't care if Lapierre made your dick hard at an international tournament last summer - he's got more concussions than goals. I'm not risking a first-round pick on that."" Point taken. The question for most scouts is which sample they find more indicative of Lapierre's true talent level. One never wants to make long term decisions based on samples of five games, and 19 games, respectively, but that's the score here. As our ranking likely makes clear; we find ourselves moved by the 19-game sample. There are some stellar tools at Lapierre's disposal. Let's start with his playmaking. He's a gifted distributor. integrating head and shoulder fakes as he challenges defenders so that he might move them from passing lanes. With a silky-smooth touch, Lapierre then hits his teammates in stride, whether handling on the backhand, the forehand, using a slip pass or a hook pass - - you name it! The one issue that we often have with Lapierre as a distributor is how unwilling he is to adapt to what's in front of him and take up shooting opportunities or the opportunity to skate the puck further up-ice. ""Lapierre was insistent on forcing passes that weren't there,"" Mitch Brown noted in a September game report. ""His instinct was pass and he fixated on it -- even when defenders moved, making the shot the better option. Many of these passes weren't simply passes that could've gone either way - - they had very little chance of going through with a very obvious shooting attempt."" Then there's his handling. It's bordering on elite. Lapierre can effortlessly weave his way through an entire team on a moment's notice, and he did that seemingly once a game during his tear at the Hlinka. Our QMJHL scout, David St-Louis, identified the three components of Lapierre's handling that make him so dangerous. He looks to get inside the triangle of defenders. Handles the puck near defensive sticks to challenge defenders to reach for it. Hands move faster than poke-checks attempts. Now. for the components of Lapierre's game that need work. Let's start with his skating. ""His skating is average, with a wide recovery, shortened extensions, and hunching over his centre of gravity,"" Brown noted in a November game report. ""His crossovers. however, give him above-average quickness for the Q, as he's able to find a bit of separation through three-to-four crossovers sometimes."" Those mechanics seem to wane in quality as his shifts get longer though, and we're convinced that this might be a conditioning problem on Lapierre's part. Certainly, that tracks with the injuries, and the amount of time in the weight room that he lost as a result. He does a good job of covering for some of these shortcomings by playing with a lot of pace, and his rush patterns through the neutral zone create a great deal of space as he carries the puck across the offensive blue line. He's also surprisingly fearless - - almost to a fault, perhaps -- when it comes to attacking the centre of the ice with possession of the puck. It's entirely possible that Lapierre could string alI of these qualities together into a cohesive offensive unit over a prolonged period and develop into one of the draft's best playmaking forwards. We'd like to think that our ranking accurately reflects that possibility with the requisite hedging that a player with this track record and this much time spent in the infirmary deserves. "
Daniel Torgersson,"The public scouting sphere seems largely divided on how to rate Frolunda HC winger Daniel Torgersson, going from a high of 27th-overall to a low of 114thamong the outlets covered on the EliteProspects 'Draft Center' page. It was much less divisive in our group. Christoffer Hedlund, our Dir. of European Scouting, gave Torgersson a glowing review, and that was good enough for us. ""I'm a way bigger fan of Torgersson than I am of John-Jason Peterka,"" Hedlund said in a spring meeting. Well, the group pushed back a bit on that, as our rankings make clear, but the sentiment helped propel Torgersson to prominence nonetheless. And really, why not? He was the fourth-most productive first-time draft-eligible skater in the J20 SuperElit, with 44 points in 39 games, playing on one of the league's most dominant lines alongside Theodor Niederbach, our 27th-ranked prospect. One can't ignore Torgersson's six games with Frolunda's men's team either. They were a remarkably deep group at forward, one that could barely accommodate Lucas Raymond in anything more than a supporting role at the best of times. Even that brief, unproductive cup of coffee at the SHL level augurs remarkably well for his long-term prospects. That's where we suspect Torgersson will land next season, in a full-time capacity. The Swedish forward doesn't have much else left to accomplish at the J20 level, and he's clearly up to the task. The biggest issue for Torgersson going into the season was his ability to play at pace and to keep up with the speed of the men's game. Those are two areas where Hedlund has identified a tremendous amount of growth over the calendar year. ""He's a good skater for his size, with a powerful push to his stride, and that should become even better once he gets stronger in his legs and improves his technique,"" Hedlund said in a Torgersson player report from earlier this season. Here's what he had to say of his in-season progress. ""Torgersson struggled a bit with high-pacing initially this season but has since improved his mobility, footwork, edgework, and adapted so that he skates in a smarter way and keeps his feet moving more than before. He handles high-pace hockey so much better than12 months ago."" His straight-line skating is so mechanically sound. Torgersson does a great job of getting low, working a full knee-bend, maintaining the correct posture, and stride recovery that lands underneath the centre of his mass. He's not all that explosive from his stance and through the first two steps, but Torgersson integrates crossovers in space to build acceleration, and really generates full leg-over-leg extension. His ankle flexion is a bit limited, and he has the tendency to generate a lot of upward, lost momentum through his body, but these are correctable habits. It's a rock solid foundation for Torgersson to build on as a skater, at the very least. That counts for a lot when one's talking about an 18-year-old with a towering 6-foot-3 frame -- there's a lot less work here than usual for the NHL development staff that has to elevate his game to NHL readiness. Now, I'm sure that you're reading this, and imagining a future where Torgersson is playing the modern NHL power forward's role, taking the puck to the net with two or three forwards draped over top of him en route to a scintillating goal worthy of Highlight of the Night status on TSN's SportCentre. That's not the role we project for Torgersson. We see him as more of a Patric Hornqvist-type; a player better suited to the net-front in a stationary capacity, deploying screens, causing mayhem, and fighting for loose pucks to send home. He's so well-balanced on his skates, and just incredibly hard to knock off of the puck. Combine that with a plus-ability to switch off of defenders, make himself available. and fire one-timers from high-percentage spots in the offensive zone, and it's a deadly package of skills. ""He's excellent at finding open space in or around the slot to give himself just enough time to shoot,"" Hedlund noted. ""He has great timing in his movements as he adjusts to the defenders and to the puck-carrier to open passing lanes."" David St-Louis, who usually scouts the QMJHL for us, did some crossover scouting of Sweden, and noted that Torgersson's pass receptions are a bit clunky. ""Torgersson has a decent flair for shooting lanes opening and moves ahead of the play most of the time to present his stick at this level, but he has trouble setting his feet to compensate for sub-optimal passes. The mechanics of his release are generally slow and clunky; he seems to really have a sweet spot in which he needs to place the puck before he can fire, which means the time lost repositioning is time given to the goalie to square himself. ""When he gets the puck on the power play, he also drags it far behind him and far from his body laterally and skates at the goalie. He loses power because the puck is released too far out and with not enough knee-bend (he leans over the puck with his body to weight down the shaft and compensate for the lack of knee-bend, but loses precision, control and quickness of release this way). The shot isn't surprising as he takes too much time to execute and the mechanics need a lot of clean-ups. I can't see him becoming a power play threat at the next levels unless he fixes some of the problems he displayed in this game."" He's a capable handler of the puck, but there are some problematic qualities that he'll need to iron out for heightened efficiency up the ranks. Chief among those problems is that Torgersson has a tendency to handle the puck far in front of him. in a straight line, which forces him into positions where a ten-bell maneuver is necessary to escape trouble constantly. We're at the point in the draft, though, where every player comes with a checklist of items that need refinement for continued success. Torgersson is hardly alone in that regard. The potential for a net-crashing, defensively reliable middle-six forward with power play utility isn't always there at this point in the draft though. That's the end-goal with Torgersson. "
Jan Mysak,"Why not start the second-round with a bang, by leading with one of the draft's most polarizing prospects, Hamilton Bulldogs centre Jan Mysak. His statistical profile, at least coming into this season, was the sort that commands first-round attention, at the very least, and a spot in the first 15 picks most often. Mysak's seven points in 31contests represent the14th-best season by a draft-minus-one skater in the Czech men's league, and it's the fifth-highest point-per-game rate in the last 20 years. Even the first-half of Mysak's draft-year in the Czech Extraliga held promise; his point-per-game rate is in the top-five among first-time draft-eligible skaters in the league's last 20 years and compares closely to Carolina Hurricanes centre Martin Necas at the same age. You'll be hard-pressed to find someone in the game who rates Mysak accordingly though. ""You'd use a first-round pick on that guy? I don't see any high-end tools and he's only an average skater,"" a Western Conference scout told us in December. Some of the industry sources we consulted with told us they wouldn't even bother using a second-round pick on Mysak. We're a bit more bullish on Mysak than many of the scouts we spoke with. There's a nice collection of skills in his game, and he's a great kid with an unrelenting motor. David St-Louis summed it up pretty well in a game report from February, saying of Mysak, ""he has some projectable offensive elements - - vision, ability as a passer off the rush, and the ability to pick corners, but he will need a lot of change to his game if he wants to play in the NHL."" He's a north-south attacker, one who skates a fair bit better in our estimation than the league gives credit, but a fairly rudimentary one at that. Mysak often attacks in a straight line, doesn't often integrate the dot-Iine, and doesn't set up his maneuvers especiaIly welI - - it's a very meat and potatoes style of attacking. Another area where Mysak excels in the offensive zone is as a forechecker. He takes smart routes to the puck, funnels opposition defenders towards support, and anticipates play well generally. It's when offensive zone possessions become more static that his abiIity to impact the game wanes. Mysak's not an especially mobile player off of the puck, and he often struggles to find his linemates consistently as a distributor, much less connect on difficult passes through layers. There's no denying Mysak's statistical profile - - it's pretty special. Then again, so was Pavel Zacha's going into his draft-year. The New Jersey Devils would probably feel a lot better about Zacha if they took him 32nd-overall rather than sixth. You'll hear a lot from certain more statistically-inclined corners of the hockey world that Mysak has a high-ceiling, but we're not convinced of as much. That's okay. You're not going to find many first-line calibre talents at this point in the draft. The long-term play with Mysak is likely that of a third-line checking winger with penalty killing value. "
Ozzy Wiesblatt,"The Wiesblatt's latest submission to the NHL Entry Draft just might be their best one yet. Prince Albert Raiders forward Ozzy Wiesblatt is a special prospect. He's arguably one of the best rush offence creators at 5-on-5 in the entire draft, and he has the production to back that up with 70 points in 64 games. Everything starts for Wiesblatt with a crossover-heavy skating stride, one which affords him three-step separation from defenders in space. He works from a constant base of activity, and never lets his foot off the gas. ""Wiesblatt is a human cheat code in transition. Seven entry attempts. all controlled and all successful - - three of them inside lane,"" Mitch Brown remarked in a February game report. ""He was so aggressive carrying the puck, but almost never got pushed to the outside unless he deemed it was the best option. His decision-making in transition is so, so refined and he's not afraid to attack layers. It's no wonder why -- twice in this game, he turned1-on-3 rushes into controlled entries and facilitated a change."" The big question that we've faced this season is whether Wiesblatt brings enough offence in static, sustained in-zone possessions, too. ""He lacks off-puck timing and spatial awareness, over skates pockets of space to attack the net and doesn't play between checks, instead planting himself beside one,"" Brown remarked in a player report. ""He's not stationary, but lacks purpose to his movements."" Another limiting factor to Wiesblatt's in-zone offence is the lack of a credible shooting threat. He'll occasionally flash a creative curl-and-drag wrist shot with a snappy, quick release, but it's not a serious threat at range. He's more of a playmaker anyway. Wiesblatt is in the 92nd percentile generating shot assists at 5-on-5 and the 96th percentile when shot quality is accounted for, as Brown does with his expected assists model. The data that our partners at lnStat Hockey collected from the Raiders regular season frames Wiesblatt's passing ability in a similar light. Despite finishing third in total ice-time with the Raiders this season, Wiesblatt finished with 37 passes to the slot,11higher than the next best Prince Albert skater. Wiesblatt is going to need to add muscle to his 5-foot-9,183-pound frame to bring this level of passing success to the NHL. He's a little too easy to push to the outside or off of the puck entirely, and that's against WHL competition. It would be in Wiesblatt's best interests to focus a little bit more on the defensive details, too. He's liable to fly the defensive zone on a moment's notice, before his team has so much as secured possession, and that's a good way to find one's self in a coach's doghouse. Our long-term projection for Wiesblatt has him carving out a lop-nine forward role, and mastering all three disciplines. It's a long-term bet. but one with the potential for a healthy reward. He could be a complementary piece in the top-six or a play-driver in the bottom-six; that's, of course, if everything breaks right. "
Tyson Foerster,"He's most comfortable setting up shop at the top of the left face-off circle, taking cross-ice feeds, and one-timing them on net with thunderous force. Foerster scored 18 of his 35 goals with the man-advantage, connecting on 25 percent of his shots in that phase of play. That shooting percentage is a bit rich, even in a league where finishing talent can really move the needle but that just means he'll need to shoot even more next year to keep up that pace. It's still very much so a tool that I'd rate as NHL projectable. The Colts primarily used Foerster as a centre, and he rewarded their faith with passing numbers commensurate with the OHL's top pivots. The data that Mitch Brown collected from the CHL and the USNTDP in 2019-20 shows Foerster rating in the 96th percentile in expected assists per hour and the 89thpercentile in shot assists per hour, both at 5-on-5.  lnStat Hockey, meanwhile, has Foerster leading the Colts in passes to the slot, completing 33 such dishes -- that's eight more than the next highest Barrie skater. They also have Foerster completing about 82 percent of his passes total. ""He sets up his feeds really well, scanning the ice for where his target will be, looking on the pass and threatening to shoot,"" Brown remarked in a March game report. Now for the bad, and if you're a master of working the process of elimination then I congratulate you on correctly assuming it's his skating. ""Your group thinks Foerster is going to figure out his skating?"" one Western Conference scout asked me. curious about our rating. ""It's not good. I just wonder if he's going to figure it out."" WelI, fair enough. Foerster finished the year with a 4-grade as a skater, and that's just not good enough to make it to the NHL. There are a lot of really enviable tools in Foerster's toolkit; he's got one of the best shots in the draft, can see the ice well, and possesses plus-defensive instincts. ""Foerster's skating remains a problem,"" Brown remarked in a March game report. ""He doesn't even sniff a separation gear. He has no corrective or recovery ability - - and when he's not playing smart (which happens) he's a negative on the ice. When compounded with a lack of pace. the lack of speed killed him in transition. He was driven wide and forced to dump the puck in with no chance of a retrieval."" If Foerster can figure his skating out, play smarter hockey, elevate his work rate, and just work on his consistency - - there's something there. We see him as a winger at the NHL level - - if he gets there - - with top-six upside and first-unit power play utility. It's just going to take a lot of work to get there. "
Roni Hirvonen,"If you're looking for a smart centre then Porin Assat forward Roni Hirvonen is your guy. Everything about his approach to the game is cold, calculated, and carried out with a ruthless efficiency. Where others try to cleave their way through the opposition; Hirvonen slices and dices with the precision of a surgeon at the operating table. He's the sort of player that warrants near-constant attention lest one miss so much of what makes him effective. Take something as simple as pursuing the puck on a dump-and-chase offensive zone entry. Hirvonen skates at defenders in an arc, tries to funnel play to where he has support, and closes on the right angle seemingly every time. We often think of the forecheck as providence of the fast or the physical - - Hirvonen is neither of those things, and still highly effective. Hirvonen is just as dutiful in the defensive zone, maintaining an elevated work rate and putting on a clinic in body-leverage going into puck retrievals. It's his defensive instincts rather than his habits, that project best to the best next level of hockey though. Hirvonen does a fantastic job of anticipating plays, closing passing or shooting lanes. and making defensive switches on the cycle. Our Finnish scout, Lassi Alanen, noted in a player report on Hirvonen that he's using an inordinately long stick for a 5-foot-9 skater too, which he uses to swat away passes. shots, loose pucks, etc. The thing about Hirvonen's processing speed upstairs is that it's a corrective mechanism for deficiencies elsewhere; he wouldn't be much of a player at all without it. Most of all, it allows Hirvonen to compensate for a lack of explosiveness, particular two-step separation from his stance. Alanen notes that Hirvonen wastes a lot of energy through his upper-body, particularly when he wields his stick like a pitchfork. firmly wrapped by both hands and swinging wildly from side to side. ""While he's agile and has solid edges: he needs to add more speed and explosiveness,"" Alanen wrote in his player report. ""He often accelerates with two hands on his stick, and generaIly skates through an inefficient stride."" To Hirvonen's credit; Alanen noted some improvement as a skater over the course of his season. There's still ample room for Hirvonen, who tends to out-toe a bit and is sometimes a bit upright, but we're already seeing some progress on this front. Just adding some lower-body strength would go a long way, too. The question we often face with Hirvonen is what sort of upside we see in the Finnish pivot. Admittedly, nothing about his game projects to the top of an NHL lineup, but good luck finding many players who fit that bill in this range. He's a capable playmaker, though, and that might be able to carry him to a middle-six role at the NHL level. He moves the puck with pace, can find teammates through levels, and sends the puck into high-danger areas with regularity. ""He's a very good passer from the right half-wall on the power play, and a smart passer in the neutral zone,"" Alanen noted. ""Hirvonen can make cross-ice feeds, drop passes, etc., and is comfortable passing from his backhand. He doesn't often make panic decisions and plays with pace."" One of the more pressing questions is whether Hirvonen is going to be able to stick at centre if or when he makes the NHL. He's clearly more comfortable at the position presently and acquitted himself well in the Finnish Liiga as an 18-year-old. There aren't many 5-foot-9 centres in the NHL and even fewer who play the position as an average skater."
Vasili Ponomaryov,"We saw some truly phenomenal performances from Shawinigan Cataractes centre Vasili Ponomaryov over the course of his draft-year. It started with a real working man's hero-type of performance for Russia at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia. He played a top-six role at 5-on-5, contributed on both sides of special teams, and finished with a tidy six points in five contests, including the 2-1 goal in his team's gold medal win over Canada. The Russian coaches, players, etc. all raved about Ponomaryov's two-way play, leadership, and unrelenting work ethic when J.D. Burke spoke to them atop the slushy summer ice of the Ice Bors Arena in Breclav as they celebrated their conquest. Then he returned to Shawinigan in the QMJHL, and the adjustment wasn't an especially smooth one. It wasn't until about mid-November that our QMJHL scout, David St-Louis, started to warm up to his game. Armed with that information, J.D. Burke and Mitch Brown went to Dawson Creek for the World Junior A Challenge ready to pay special attention to the Russian pivot. And did they ever get their money's worth. ""The four points (one goaI, three assists) next to Ponomaryov's name just don't do his performance justice. He was the Russian's best centre - no disrespect to Marat Khusnutdinov, who put in one hell of a performance in his own right - and his playmaking generated chances for whoever skated alongside him."" The motor on this kid is unrelenting. That much became obvious at the Hlinka, and then he sent the message home at the WJAC. He never took a shift off. But the one thing that really caught our scouts' attention was that Ponomaryov was running up and down the Encana Events Centre in Dawson Creek for a solid half-hour-plus after every game, win or loss. He was also just a treat to talk to, for whatever that's worth - - great kid! That motor is the basis for Ponomaryov's defensive habits. He backtracks well through the neutral zone, consistently applies back-pressure, and is dogged in 50-50 puck battles. He's a legitimate two-way centre, the type that makes his presence felt at every corner of the ice. lt's his play without the puck that shined the most,"" St-Louis noted in a February game report. ""Ponomaryov quickly pressures all over the ice. He is like a bouncing ball switching from different assignments. always stick-first to take as many options away as he can."" In the offensive zone, that starts with some of the better forechecking patterns in this class. Ponomaryov constantly scans the ice, maintains a detailed mental map bordering on topographical in its scope. He then herds defencemen into support. It's the sort of thing one can only really appreciate with frequent in-person viewings - - it's in that setting where one can really see his scheming work. Granted, Ponomaryov would be even more of a force on the forecheck with a better, more modern skating stride. He's got that 80'sstyle approach, with a wide base and hips that flair, and that limits his power. It's something he's compensated for thus far with a high activity rate, but I'd look to iron that out if I was on the development staff of whichever team drafts him this October. Similarly, some of his habits in the offensive zone could use a little work. Ponomaryov is a highly-skilled distributor, as evidenced by his use of the WARP (wraparound reverse pass) play, but he's guilty as sin of tunnel vision. Adaptability is one of Ponomaryov1s weak spots, St-Louis noted in a player report. ""He gets fixated on certain plays, executes them even when closed, and has trouble changing his play against good defensive responses."" He's not much of a threat to finish either. Ponomaryov lacks a one-timer, and while his wrist shot mechanics show promise, it's not a weapon he's often wont to yield. The one question we have about Ponomaryov’s capability is what impact playing in Shawinigan had on his outputs; his production has been just fine in international settings. There just wasn't much offensive support on that roster aside from Mavrik Bourque, but the two rarely shared the ice at 5-on-5. For whatever it's worth, St-Louis anticipates a big jump in scoring for Ponomaryov next season. Here's hoping. The foundation is there, and if he fixes his skating, refines his approach in the offensive zone, then Ponomaryov could be a Swiss Army Knife-type of middle-six forward. "
Brock Faber,"We've rated United States National Team Development Program defenceman Brock Faber higher than any of the other outlets accounted for on the EliteProspects 'Draft Center' page, and we had to resist the temptation to put him even higher. Cameron Robinson, our Dir. of Film Scouting, agitated almost unrelentingly for the University of Minnesota-committed defender near the end of the first-round. We pushed back as a group, reaching consensus for Faber at 37th-overall. For whatever it's worth, the scouts and front office executives we've consulted rate Faber going in this range - - somewhere in the middle of the second-round, anyway - - and each gave a glowing review about his character. ""Man, I want to find a way to draft this kid,"" was a common refrain. J.D. Burke was just a little bit ahead of the curve. Covering the USHL Fall Classic in Pittsburgh, Burke left the tournament convinced that Faber, not Jake Sanderson, put on the best showing on the NTDP's blueline. ""Don't let the national team's depth chart fool you - - Brock Faber is as competent a defender as you'll find on that blue line,"" Burke wrote. ""Through the admittedly minuscule sample of games I've seen, Faber's been the program's best defenceman period."" Nobody on our staff -- Burke included - - holds Faber in that esteem presently but it was a nice snapshot of his capability, one that made his radar ping just a little bit brighter on our radar for the remainder of the season. If you want a modern defensive defender - - then Faber is your guy. It all stems from his skating mechanics. They're among the best in this class. Our American scout, Joey Padmanabhan, rated Faber a 7, and that puts him near the top of the board for that category. He gets so, so low to the ice, a testament to the three-point flexion that goes from his boots through the knees and on to the hips. The deep knee-bend is especially important in this regard. He keeps his skates underneath the centre of his mass, which allows him to use the entirety of his blade to generate acceleration. ""He's a great skater who uses weight shifts well while gliding to avoid getting knocked over on the rush,"" Padmanabhan wrote in his Faber player report. There are some defenders who defend the blue line violently; others are more calculated. Faber suffocates the opposition, guiding them with his stick to the outside and enveloping them.  Faber's most frequent partner at 5-on-5 was Tyler Kleven, and that meant that it wasn't enough to dispossess the opposition of the puck - - he had to move it back up-ice, too. The data that Mitch Brown collected from the CHL and the NTDP shows Faber in the 90th percentile or better in each of the three zone exit categories, including controlled exit percentage relative to his team, controlled exit success relative percentage, and controlled exits per hour, all at 5-on-5. He's every bit as capable carrying the puck as he is dispatching of it and letting one of his forwards do the work - - the one constant is that Faber always takes excellent care of the puck. You're not going to get much offence out of this 18-year-old blue liner, but even so, he might have more to offer than his paltry boxcars suggest - - Faber finished the year with 12 points in 46 games. Faber did a pretty damn good job of generating expected assists and shot assists per hour at 5-on-5, according to Brown's data. It's not hard to imagine a scenario where his playmaking was lost on this year's forwards on the program - - it was a down year up front, and not just relative to gaudy 2018-19 group. ''Faber is unafraid to function as an additional forward off the rush, but also moves the puck and drops back to defend when necessary,"" Padmanabhan wrote. ""He recognizes when he has support behind him to pinch and is responsible in his own zone, being sure not to vacate too early."" Don't bank on Faber quarterbacking an NHL power play though. Think of him as a transitional, defensive defenceman, one not all that dissimilar to a Chris Tanev-type at the NHL level. That'd be a hell of a get in this range. "
Tyler Tullio,"There aren't many 5-foot-9 average skaters in the NHL - - Oshawa Generals forward Tyler Tullio ventures to be the next exception to the rule. Let's take a look at the tools that'll help him in this endeavour, starting with the way that Tullio breaks down a defence mentally. He's a little bit like a vulture circling carrion when he's off of the puck; scanning the zone, waiting for an opening, and expertly timing his descent into a pocket of space. When he's sunk his claws into the puck, it's already too late for the opposing netminder - - he'll find himself digging it out of the back of his net. ""Tullio continually found pockets of space, often with a timed move, leading to several chances including a goal,"" Mitch Brown noted in a February game report. ""He's not a threat from range, but his quick release and crafty placement gave the goaItender troubles."" That's how Tullio generates the bulk of his offence, and that shows up in the underlying data that Brown collected from the USNTDP and CHL this season. Tullio created expected goals in the 79th percentile and shots in the 82nd percentile, both at 5-on-5, according to that sample of data. When the shot isn't an option, Tullio shows a great deal of adaptability, integrating one-touch maneuvers, playing pucks into space, manipulating defenders out of shooting lanes - - you name it, and he can do it. ""He continually sent out false information along the boards or while handling in open-ice, confusing defenders and increasing his odds of success,"" Brown said in another February report. ""He enters this narrow glide and looks off as he waits for defenders to bite, then he cuts back and drives play to the middle. It was non-stop. ""He saw an opportunity, and manipulated the defender(s) until he found a way to get inside. He established body contact with little nudges, then working right through the hands. Pressure doesn't faze him; he was equally adept working through traffic as he was space."" Where this style sometimes hinders Tullio is in the mileage it visits upon his body. Our game reports are riddled with concerns about this playing style, then followed up with instances in which he went to the room for repairs, had to leave the game for a chunk of time, etc. ""He puts himself in really vulnerable positions to be hit and he took a hit from behind in the first period that required medical attention,"" our OHL scout, Rachel Doerrie, noted in a mid-February game report. ""This is definitely an issue, as he found himself shaken up on three separate occasions."" The other way to look at this, of course, is that Tullio is tough as nails. He didn't miss any of the Generals 62 games last season, even with all those bumps and bruises along the way, and never seemed to alter his playing style to avoid physical contact. The question is whether that will hold up over an 82-game NHL season played against grown men. Never mind the question of whether he'lI be able to attack those pockets of space with that same sort of off the puck patterns without adding an extra gear or two. ""His stride remains a touch too upright and he gets so much weaker throughout his shift,"" Brown said in a February game report. ""He's a little bit top heavy as a skater and the extension on his stride is super inefficient,"" J.D. Burke said in a March game report. ""There's a big kick going on there that he ought to calm down a bit."" He hasn't displayed enough as a distributor to give us the impression that that element is going to carry over to the next level. There are moments. Tullio has real touch as a passer and can layer deception, but he's not an advanced playmaker by any means. The long-term play with Tullio is one that sees him improve as a skater, continue to add strength, and eventually ascend to an NHL lineup in a top-nine role as a scoring winger. He plays with a high motor and shows a real attention to detail on the defensive side, and that might give him some added two-way value and versatility throughout the lineup. too."
Danil Gushchin,"Whatever outdated stereotypes that the 200 Hockey Men have tried burning into your brain about Russian hockey players - - throw them out the window for Muskegon Lumberjacks winger Daniil Gushchin. He may be small, standing just 5-foot-8. He may be skilled, with some of the best small-ice puck skills in the game. But Gushchin works his ass off every shift and his commitment to the defensive side of the game is every bit as robust as his scoring punch. ""He's a great, tenacious back checker who often almost functions as a third defenseman in transition at times,"" our American scout Joey Padmanabhan said in a March game report. ""He also showed some edge, and though in corner battles he got completely outmuscled; he wasn't afraid to throw his body around and go after opponents."" The data that our partners at InStat Hockey collected from the Lumberjacks season shows that Gushchin's presence tilted the shot clock heavily in their favour. Guschin finished the year with a plus-149 shot attempt differential, 40 higher than the next highest skater on the team. ""He takes smart routes to the puck on the forecheck, and he's surprisingly physical for someone his size,"" J.D. Burke noted in a January game report. ""He's just fearless as a rule, whether it's taking the puck to the slot or trying to muscle someone much larger than him off of the puck. We love to see it; we really do."" Now that we've summarily dismissed any of that silliness, let's look at how Gushchin makes hay. He's such a gifted handler of the puck, particularly in the small-ice game. There's so much thought going into every move, whether it's a shiver with his shoulder to force a defensive zig right as he intends to zag, or the angle of his attack. ""The winger doesn't just rely on quick hands to pull oof his dangles; he sets up really well by faking a shot or a pass first and then separates by accelerating inside his movements,"" David St-Louis wrote in a November game report. ""His execution on those feints, his ability to incorporate patience, deception, and foot-work, lets you think that they will continue to work and be a part of his game at the next levels."" Hell, it seems like Gushchin even puts some thought into his equipment as a handler, using an inordinately small stick - - even relative to his diminutive stature - - which helps him stay low and produce AND1 Mixtape calibre maneuvers. It also lets him put his full weight behind each wrist shot, generating a ton of torque through his release. The only problem is that it seemed like these shots came off of his stick with the velocity of a Randy Johnson fastball and the accuracy of a Josh Allen deep ba11 - - so few of those shots landed on goal, particularly from range. Players as small as Gushchin need to be able to skate at a high level, and that seems to really be the case here. ""Perhaps the most skilled draft-eligible player in the USHL, Gushchin offers high-end speed and stickhandling that makes him a threat from anywhere inside the offensive blue line,"" Padmanabhan noted in his player report. ""Gushchin, despite his 5-foot-8 frame, has an uncanny ability to burn past defenders along the perimeter unscathed."" It's an impressive collection of skills and tools for a player that has the work ethic to put it all together. Gushchin is going to need work on his finishing ability from range, add muscle, and then maybe another gear as a skater, too. We're not big fans of labelling players as 'boom or bust' but Gushchin definitely seems like that sort of player. The Regina Pats waived their rights to Gushchin ahead of the 2020 CHL Import Draft, and the Niagara lce Dogs took him with the 4thpick in this year's go-around. We're really looking forward to following this player's development as he transitions to the CHL. "
Topi Niemela,"Topi Niemela refuses to play with his age group. He made that clear at last year's U18 World Hockey Championships as the only 17-year-old on Finland's blue line and continued the trend by starting on Oulun Karpat's men's team in the Finnish Liiga. The latter of those two feats - - playing on Karpat's men's roster - - really warrants acclaim. They're one of the Liiga's top teams, and they're notoriously stingy about letting first-time draft-eligible skaters into their lineup. Niemela may have only played on the team's third-pairing at 5-on-5 and sparingly if at all on special teams -- for a total of just under 13 minutes a night. according to lnStat - - but just being there counts for a lot period. If there's one commonality across every draft analytics model that I've encountered, it's that players who feature in men's leagues as 18-year-olds tend to have an elevated likelihood of success at the NHL level. That appears to be the case for Niemela, whose draft-year spent in the Liiga comes with a 58 percent likelihood of success according to Jeremy Davis' pGPS model. That number would be much, much higher if Niemela had produced even just the tiniest bit more than he did - - though seven points in 43 games at that age is nothing to scoff at. That's not really Niemela's game though. We've identified him as more of a modern defensive defenceman than the sort of point-producing rearguard that's helped define this year's playoffs. ""His playmaking in the offensive zone is a weakness. He hasn't shown great vision."" our Finnish scout Lassi Alanen noted in Niemela's player report. ""He's a high-volume shooter from the point but lacks diversity in the offensive third."" He's a smart player, and our staff has noticed a reaI willingness on his part to activate on the rush. It's just that these are complementary qualities to Niemela's game, and not hallmarks. Where Niemela is most proficient is in the way he transitions the puck up-ice. He takes phenomenal care of the puck, can distribute through layers in the neutral zone, isn't afraid to use the centre of the ice, and just displays a high level of competence with the puck on his stick. It helps to have strong habits on defensive puck retrievals. Niemela smartly scans the ice with shoulder checks as he skates to collect the puck, then smartly and decisively acts in a way that quickly moves play in the other direction. Alanen noted as much in one of his February game reports... ""Niemela's puck retrievals stood out early in the game. His skating and fearless attitude allow him to get to pucks first and he has the brain to make the right decision quickly most of the time. There was one particular occasion where Niemela made a well-timed stick check along the boards, got the puck and moved it quickly for a breakout."" He's not a great puck handler, and that can prove limiting in small-ice situations where most of his teammates just aren't realistic passing options. ""Niemela can maneuver against two opposing forecheckers in one shift but then dump the puck out for no good reason the next,"" Alanen said in his Niemela player report. ""His hands are fine, but he's not a high-end handler; the opposition can pressure him into making bad decisions at times, at least playing against men in the Liiga."" Perhaps the best quality in Niemela's game is his skating - - in fact, it's his highest graded tool with a 6. ""He has good speed, and mobility that allows him to play a pretty tight gap in transition,"" Alanen wrote. ""He's a mechanically pretty solid skater with good acceleration that allows him to escape pressure coming from forecheckers."" With plus-skating, Niemela is able to defend the defensive blue line with relative ease, playing with a relatively passive posture but nonetheless keeping opponents to the outside on most occasions. His in-zone defending is relatively advanced for a player his age, too. The big question on Alanen's mind is whether Niemela has the hockey sense to develop into a top-four defenceman at the NHL level. ""His brain is not on the same level with Ville Heinola, for one example, who made fewer mistakes with the puck in his draft-eligible season. Niemela does have the edge in terms of skating, though."" The most likely outcome for a player with Niemela's skill set - - if he makes the NHL at all, and that's never a guarantee - - is that of a third-pairing option with second-unit utility in both phases of special teams. "
Kasper Simontaival,"NHL Draft Twitter is going to think we have Kasper Simontaival too low. and I suspect the NHL is going to let us know that we have him too high with their drafting process in early October. We've somehow found a way to piss off both groups, and it'll be interesting to see whether that's to our credit or detriment in the years that follow - - only one of us can prove right. Here's the thing - - it's really, really difficult for short forwards with average or below average skating to hang in the big leagues, even in the modern NHL. Whether that's a market inefficiency that's ripe for the exploiting is a worthwhile question, certainly, but that's just the way the league operates presently. One can yell about what the NHL should or shouldn't be - - don't weall love to do that? - - until the endof time, but at a certain point, one has to react to the environment in which they're operating. So, yes, the odds are stacked against Simontaival, a 5-foot-9 winger with a 5-grade asa skater, almost right off the hop. Here's why we like his chances - - everything short of his skating and stature are at a high, high level. He's a true dual-threat winger with two-way upside, a sturdy frame, and the type of competitiveness necessary to hang in there as a vertically-challenged forward. ""No doubt about it - Simontaival is a high-octane offensive driver,"" our Finnish scout Lassi Alanen wrote of Simontaival in an April article on EPRinkside. ""Whether it's his strength on the puck in the corners and along boards or his off the puck positioning - there's a lot to like about Simontaival's game in the offensive zone. ''Though he's far from a one-dimensional sniper, the 5-foot-9 winger has a lethal re/ease that can beat goalies from tough angles and long distances. He wields the best shot out of Finland in this year's draft. ""Simontaival's wrist shot captivates with countless standout traits. He generates the sort of power one might expect from a one-time slapshot with seemingly little effort. He's devious, masking his intentions to the goaltender right up to the release, often changing the angle with pullbacks and other adjustment techniques."" The other thing to note about SimontaivaI is that he's nearly as potent a distributor of the puck, too - - Alanen gave him a 7-grade as a shooter and a 6.5-grade as a passer. He's a competent passer on his forehand and backhand alike, can effectively deploy slip and hook passes, and displays great vision off of the half-wall with consistency. He's especially good in this regard on the power play, where the opposition has to focus so readily on his shot. Simontaival is a legitimate dual-threat scorer. and each skill informs the other; it's a lot easier to deceive and manipulate the opposition if they have to account for the shot and the pass as equally credible threats. And while Simontaival isn't a strong skater, it's worth noting that his sturdy frame allows him to hang in there against much larger defencemen. He gets really low to protect the puck, and can sometimes prove a handful to push off of it. Those same defencemen need to account for Simontaival as a physical threat on the forecheck, too. He's an eager contributor on dump-and-chase plays, with a heightened understanding of how to get low and leverage himself going into contact. He wins a surprising number of those puck battles. If Simontaival can improve his skating, then there's a real chance that he could develop into a top-nine winger that can contribute on the half-wall for an NHL power play. "
Sean Farrell,"The Chicago Steel were an offensive powerhouse in the USHL last season, and right winger Sean Farrell helped form the foundation. The Steel led the USHL in goals, scoring 242 times in 49 games - - that's 58 more goals than the next best team, the USNTDP U18 squad - - and Farrell played right wing on the top line with Brendan Brisson (our 15th-ranked prospect) and Mathieu De St. Phalle. Farrell's job on that line was simple: Get the puck to Brisson and De St. Phalle in prime positions to score, and he rose to the occasion with aplomb. His 41assists are in a tie with Dubuque Fighting Saints prospect Ty Jackson for first in the USHL. ""An undersized forward with elite playmaking ability, Sean Farrell has come into his own this year,"" our American scout Joey Padmanabhan wrote in a November player report. ""He's an adept passer, as well and finds teammates in dangerous areas on offence."" He's just so damn smart and creative with the puck on his stick, and he's not afraid to try highly-difficult passing plays either. Whether it was at the World Junior A Challenge or in the USHL - - Farrell consistently displayed an ability to find linemates through defensive layers, in prime scoring positions. The data that our partners at lnStat collected from the Steel's season show Farrell completing 37 passes to the slot (1), eight more than the next highest skater on his team, Mackie Samoskevich That number would be even more gaudy with ice-time adjustments; Farrell played the fourth-most minutes of any forward on the team. Then again, that's a pretty consistent theme with Farrell - - adjusted scoring metrics give him a hefty raise right across the board. While Farrell ranked third on the Steel in first-time draft-eligible scoring, the SEAL (Situational Era Age League) scoring adjustments that Jeremy Davis modelled bump him up to second among that group. We're going to need to see some substantial growth from Farrell as a skater for him to continue to find this sort of scoring success at the next level. It's not that he's necessarily a poor skater - - Padmanabhan meted out a 6-grade for his skating - - but that he's not a good enough skater to continue to attack the way he does in professional hockey. ""Farrell plays the game at a high-pace, but he needs to get better at using lateral space, changing gears off the rush, and generally add speed at his size to beat defenders,"" David St-Louis, a notoriously unforgiving evaluator remarked. ""His high-momentum attack won't be enough against professionals as his current speed won't be enough; he will have to manipulate and use teammates in between blue-lines to retain his high controlled entry success rate. Farrell's skating has some mechanical problems: He recovers wide, very wide; the intensity of the stride, the way he works through less-than-ideal patterns makes him fly up-ice at this level."" While we, as a group, probably have a bit more time for Farrell's footwork than St-Louis, specifically, there isn't one among us who would dispute any of the claims about his mechanical shortcomings. They're well-made. and most importantly, true. Shifting back to Farrell's strengths; Padmanabhan kept coming back to Farrell's work in the defensive zone as an underrated component of his game. It's a consistent theme through our game reports, some of which include tales of Farrell's penalty killing. ""Farrell's defensive game has come leaps and bounds from where it was when the season started,"" Padmanabhan noted in his year-end player report. ""He picks up a man nicely in transition and back-checks hard. When he plays in the middle, he supports his defence nicely in corner battles despite not having the most strength or largest frame. He has also been relied upon to play in penalty kill situations down the stretch."" It's going to be interesting to see where Farrell's development takes him. There's some obvious areas for improvement, with his skating, and shooting foremost among them but a strong foundation in place. It's also going to be interesting to see where Farrell develops period. Harvard, as a member of the ECAC conference in the NCAA, doesn't appear likely to play hockey during the 2019-20 season -- fucking 2020, am I right, folks? Our scouts, and Padmanabhan in particular, believe in Farrell's top-six playmaking winger upside at the NHL level. "
Lukas Reichel,"Everything about Eisbaren Berlin winger Lukas Reichel's statistical profile screams first-round upside. Playing in a men's league as a first-time draft-eligible skater? Check. Producing in a men's league as a first-time draft-eligible skater? Reichel finished the year with 24 points in 42 DEL games, and did so producing more offence at 5-on-5 on a per hour basis than Tim Stutzle and John-Jason Peterka. Showing up on the international stage? Reichel finished with as many points as Stutzle at the U20 World Hockey Championship. Hell, even some of the underlying data that I've seen on the team side shows Reichel as a shot-quality driving forward with a solid two-way profile. Everything on paper suggests that Reichel is firmly a first-round prospect. If only we'd seen any of it manifest with any level of consistency on his game tape or our in-person viewings. For posterity's sake, our Dir. of European Scouting, Christoffer Hedlund, has a bit more time for Reichel's game than the rest of the group. Even so, that's a relative statement - - it's not like Hedlund was pounding the table as we worked our way through our final board. There are, of course, some undeniable physical tools at Reichel's disposal. The best of them all is his skating. Reichel covers a ton of ground, with sound mechanics, a strong lower-body, and an elevated work rate. ""Reichel maintains consistent energy through shift,"" our Reichel player report reads. ""He's an unrelenting forechecker and back checker, never gives up on a play, and wins battles through second-efforts."" Mitch Brown, our Dir. of North American Scouting, and a notoriously harsh grader, even went so far as to describe Reichel's skating stride as ""gorgeous"" in one of his player reports. ""Lukas Reichel wields two-step separation gear in open ice and the small-area alike: it's powerful stride with consistent extensions and under-the-torso recovery, consistent knee-over-knee crossover extension with occasional linear crossover use,"" Brown elaborated in a player report. ""He's always in motion in transition; maintains feet through stickhandling and pressure; uses changes of pace to lull defenders in false sense of security; stride remains strong late in shifts."" It's a really solid foundation for an attacking winger like Reichel. The amenities ain't bad either. Reichel is a pretty capable puck-handler - - even at top-speed - - carrying the puck through a defender's triangle, showing a predilection for outside-in maneuvers, and deploying weight shifts to avoid contact. It's just that Reichel's rock-solid foundation, complete with all of the amenities, lacks the framework to make a cohesive offensive whole. As the shot map, courtesy of our partners at InStat, makes clear, Reichel has no problem taking the puck to the slot. He's proven relatively productive from those spots too, whether in the DEL or playing in the World Juniors. The question, for us, is whether that is going to continue to be the case for Reichel at the next level. Does he have the strength or dexterity to consistently work his way to the middle of the ice against NHL competition? Does he have the off of the puck habits, timing, and spacing necessary to get to those spots in the NHL? ""Reichel is often stationary and reactionary with the offensive zone established - - this is especially noticeable on the power play,"" Brown remarked in his year-end Reichel player report. ""He's too late to move into pockets of space despite his plus-skating. He's rarely ready to shoot in catch-and-release and one-timer options. and he relies on individual rushes to generate dangerous shots."" Another matter that works against Reichel in his projection is that he's just not an especially threatening shooter at range - - he's going to need to get to the high-danger portions of the offensive zone to consistently produce at the NHL level. ""Reichel's shot is average to slightly above-average with power and shot variety,"" one year-end report reads. These limitations, of course, aren't out of the ordinary with players in this range. That's garden variety stuff at this point in the draft. It's just that there are enough countervailing points in Reichel's favour that we felt it necessary to spell out our work and make clear our thought process. It's not like we don't like Reichel. Hell, we like him more than the vast majority of the players that made our board. It's just that we have a hard time reconciling a first-round position in an environment where that's increasingly common. There's a pathway for Reichel to develop into a first-round-type of talent. The more likely outcome though, as far as we're concerned, is a player with plus-defensive value at 5-on-5 and the penalty kill that can chip in with some secondary offensive in an NHL bottom-six. "
Roby Jarventie,"They don't come much more frustrating than KOOVEE winger Roby Jarventie. There's so much to work with here - - every one of his tools got a 5-grade or better from our Finnish scout Lassi Alanen. The production, 38 points (23 goals and 15 assists) in 36 games playing KOOVEE in the Finnish second-tier men's league, the Mestis, is spectacular. Yet our scouts left every viewing wondering what Jarventie could be if he put everything together rather than enamoured with what they saw at present. Such is often life in this chunk of the industry, but this is an extraordinary case. We found morbid comfort in the fact that Jarventie's underlying numbers suggested that much of that historic production at the Mestis level appeared to be percentage driven. As it turns out, his scoring never really aligned with what we were seeing because much of it was smoke and mirrors. ""His on-ice shooting percentage at 5-on-5 with KOOVEE was 15.5 and if you count Jarventie's shooting percentage using goals and shots on goal, his individual shooting percentage would be 27,"" Alanen noted in his year-end player report. 'That's definitely not sustainable."" That Jarvenite went from producing historically in the Mestis, to barely at all in the Finnish first-tier men's league, the Liiga, to a pedestrian rate in the U20 SM-Sarja helps further build the case - - granted, we're talking two separate samples of five games, for whatever that's worth. It's a shame, because Jarventie's tools rate comfortably in the first-round. Whether it's his plus-level shot, complete with accuracy, smart placement, and a quick release or his feel for the game offensively, one which seems to always lead him to scoring chances at just the right time - - there's some great stuff there. From Alanen's player report, ""Jarventie's shot has good placement. He's got a pretty accurate wrist shot, good shooting mechanics. and he's pretty clinical finisher from close range."" ""He scores a lot by having a feel for where the puck is going to be next; Jarventie anticipates play well in the offensive zone."" Rounding out Jarventie's tool kit are some pretty slick puck skiIIs. He can pull off some pretty impressive moves while playing at full-speed, and consistently displays good habits by keeping the puck close to his frame, with his elbow away from his body, and often with the puck beyond the defender's reach as it's inside their skates-to-stick triangle. The one complaint that shows up consistently through our game reports is that Jarventie often finds himself pushed to the outside a little too easily, particularly considering his projectable 6-foot-2 frame. Speaking of consistent themes. Every single scout with a game report to their credit on Jarventie's file agrees that he looks like he's Just flying out there with some truly bizarre mechanical quirks. The most peculiar of all of them is just how hard Jarventie lands on his inside edges while simultaneously out-toeing. ""Jarventie's skating will be an interesting developmental project,"" Mitch Brown noted in a March game report. ""The general shakiness and inconsistency of his stride suggests a weak lower-body. He gets extension of his crossovers, going knee-over-knee to generate power without much noise. His stride consistently finishes on his inside edges with outward-facing toes. ""Without the puck, he recovers wide - - especiaIly on the left side - - and often caves in at the knees as the recovering leg leaves the ice. The left-right imbalance translates to the upper body, as Jarventie dips his left shoulder and swings his arm across his body more than he does on his right. With the puck, his stride is wide, but a bit narrower than without the puck and he's able to generate a bit more power."" ""On the rare occasions that Jarventie actually got his feet moving, the kid can really fly,"" J.D Burke noted in another March report. ""It's hard to square with the mechanics - - he's such an inside-edge skater and a little upright for my tastes."" There's a certain point where scouts - - and you can count the royal we (the royal us?) among them - - get a little too Inside BasebalI, focusing too much on the mechanics rather than the output. I can't help but wonder if this is the case with Jarventie who often looks fast, even if he's not looking fast in the way we're accustomed to seeing. One area that's unambiguously not good enough? That would Jarventie's commitment to the details of the game, particularly in the defensive zone. Calling his work rate pithy would be generous. To make matters worse, he's awfully prone to puck-watching, often losing his man as a result. ""There are spurts of good effort from Jarventie, but it's not consistent enough,"" Alanen noted in his player report. ""He should be winning more puck battles with his frame."" ""He's prone to puck watching and floating in the defensive zone; he could do a much better job of supporting the breakout by not cheating for offence."" To make matters worse, Jarventie takes awful care of the puck on the rare occasion when it lands on his stick in the defensive zone, and can often disappear from his team's transition efforts. As currently constructed, Jarventie is a one-dimensional scorer, but a fairly unpolished one with a lot of room for growth. It's going to take a strong developmental staff to coax the best out of this player but the payoff could prove immense. Alanen thinks that Jarventie can develop into a complementary top-nine winger with second-line upside at the NHL level if everything breaks right. "
Emil Heineman,"I'm not sure anyone outside of the first-round saw their stock rise faster and further than Leksands IF winger Emil Heineman. Let's use the NHL's Central Scouting Bureau to make the case. When they dropped their mid-term rankings in January, they rated Heineman as the 86th-best European skater. They moved him to 26th among European skaters in their final rankings, a full 60 spots higher. This begs the question: What happened? How does a player rise 60 spots from January to June? It started with some strong performances on Heineman's part at the U19 5 Nations tournament in February, in which he scored twice and added three assists over a five-game run. That performance vaulted Heineman from the J20 SuperElit - - where he'd scored a tidy 41 points in 29 games - - to Leksands' SHL club, where he found a home for the remainder of the season in a depth role. The consistent theme? Heineman elevated his game whenever the stage got brighter. and scouts took notice. There's something to be said for rising to the occasion, and Heineman repeatedly did, well, that. There isn't any one role that Heineman fits. He's a Jack of all trades type of player, the type that can fit anywhere in the lineup and play any role. depending on what the moment calls for. There are two components in Heineman's game that tie everything nicely together into one cohesive unit. The first of those items is his skating. Heineman's a mechanically refined skater, with three-point flexion at the ankles, knees, and hips, stride discipline, and a sound posture. Our only real complaint is that for all his mechanical fortitude, he's not the most explosive skater; it takes him a little while to get to his top speed. ""Heineman starts with decent first steps, but he could be more explosive from a standstill,"" our Dir. of European Scouting Christoffer Hedlund wrote in his player report. ""He's a good mechanical skater gathering speed, and he only improved in this regard as the season wore on. There's a strong push to his stride, which gives him added acceleration and top speed while skating in a straight line, most notably over medium or longer distances."" The second item is Heineman's activity rate. He's always got his feet moving, always maintains a high battle-level, and never shies away from making personal sacrifices to improve the two-way health of his team. ""He's alert and active off the puck when he tries to get involved in his team's offence,"" Hedlund noted. ""Heineman maintains an elevated work rate, all over the ice, and seems to relish getting to the dirty areas. He often just plainly outworks his opponents to leave puck battles with possession."" That sort of working man hero's approach really caught J.D. Burke's attention during a Leksands game from March during one of his film sessions. ""His habits are great. Heineman backchecked like a man-possessed, threw some massive hits, and seemed to have a good sense of when to collapse low into the defensive zone. He isn't afraid of taking a beating either. Darts to the front of the net through low-to-high passing plays, and he's an absolute pest in offensive zone retrievals. Dug one puck out of the corner and fed his teammate for a glorious chance in the slot."" One area where Heineman struggles a bit is with the pace of the professional game. This was a constant problem for him at the SHL level, where his lack of a one-touch passing game, occasional indecisiveness, and a lack of plus-level puck skills regularly conspired to cost him possession of the puck. ""He undeniably has some issues when the pace is high, resuIting in a lot of turnovers and stops and starts,"" Hediund noted. ""He's far more effective when hecan gather speed and attack through a straight line."" ""He's a decent puck-handler but has a very straight forward, basic approach."" Hedlund continued, ""he shows the occasional flash of creativity, and he has the finesse to beat opponents 1-on-1. It's just that these aren't major parts of his game."" Not everyone be a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes, it's enough to dig your way to the big leagues. Even Caesar couldn't have won the Siege of Alesia and finished his conquest of the Gauls without the engineers that fortified the perimeters. Can we take a moment to pour one out for Vercingetorix? Anyway, overwrought battlefield analogies notwithstanding - - Emil Heineman brings a lot to the table. He's going to be a coach's favourite no matter where he plays. There are some worthwhile questions about what sort of upside Heineman brings to the table, but one needn't be especially skilled if they get to the right spots on the ice consistently. There are some plus-level tools, and some phenomenal habits present in Heinaman's game. He could be a real two-way, impact player in an NHL team's bottom-six. "
Joni Jurmo,"If playing entertaining hockey was the same thing as playing hockey well, then Jokerit defenceman Joni Jurmo would be far, far higher up our list. It's easy enough - - fun even - - to watch Jurmo string high-risk play after high-risk play together watching comfortably from the stands: it's taking years off of his coach's lives though. That's before one even broaches the question of whether the risk outweighs the reward. The variance from Jurmo is truly astonishing. We've seen him execute some extremely difficult plays, and then flub absolute gimmes on the same damn shift. Maybe confounding is the better word to describe this quality to his game? So, this is to say, we're not alone in our... frustration. Now that we've set the stage, let's break Jurmo's game down one component at a time. He's the prototypical puck-moving defenceman. Jurmo's projectable 6-foot-4 frame, and smooth-skating lend itself to covering large swaths of ice and carrying the puck from one zone to the next sometimes effortlessly. ""Jurmo's arguably one of the best skaters going in a straight line in the draft class among defencemen,"" our Finnish scout Lassi Alanen wrote in a February article. ""It's the speed that he generates that makes him one of the better puck-rushers in the Finnish U20 league. I would argue no other blue liner playing at that level this season can create exits and entries by carrying the puck with such consistency and finesse."" Ultimately, Alanen handed Jurmo a 7-grade for his skating. ""Jurmo has high-end speed going forward, with great usage of crossovers to gain speed and deceive opponents,"" Alanen wrote in a year-end player report. ""He accelerates well when he's already in motion and is a deceptive skater in the neutral zone with crossovers and changes of pace."" This, of course, helps Jurmo maintain a tight, consistent gap through the neutral zone, with risk mitigating footwork and a good sense of spacing with his defensive partner. He's got a long reach, and a willingness to close physically. Things get a little bit more shaky once the opposition has established in-zone possession though. Jurmo's reach, an active stick, and plus-positioning allow him to take away large chunks of the defensive zone without over-extending himself or expending needless energy. ""Defensively, he's passable,"" Mitch Brown remarked in a January game report. ""Jurmo has adequate fundamentals. such as non-committing footwork and routes to pressure shoots and disrupts the cycle. He's comfortable working high in the defensive zone. However, he struggles breaking up the cycle because he doesn't shadow footwork welI. He hunts the break up with much situational awareness. Consequently, many players are able to shake him off after just one change of direction."" In his year-end Jurmo player report, Alanen noted that there is sti11 plenty of room for physical growth. If Jurmo can add a little more muscle to his 6-foot-4 frame, he could be a real problem for opposing forwards. Another area where we'd like to see some substantial growth from Jurmo is in the offensive zone. His 28 points (five goals and 23 assists) in 43 games put him in a tie with Slovak rearguard Samuel Knazko for the second-most offence in the U20 SM-Sarja last year. Things look pretty damn good for Jurmo on the surface. It's just that we haven't seen a ton of creativity from Jurmo in the offensive zone, and this is especially true at 5-on-5. The vast majority of his offence came from rush activation. ""Jurmo excels in transition and can pull off end-to-end rushes, but doesn't provide a lot of offence from the point at even-strength,"" Alanen noted. ""He's not a very sophisticated passer in the offensive zone."" The data that our partners at lnStat collected from Jokerit's U20 team's season indicates Jurmo only completed three passes to the slot too - - there's a nice little bit of harmony between the eye test and the stats. Our evaluation of Jurmo strongly suggests that there's a pretty strong set of physical tools at his disposal, and some refinement around the margins could lend itself to a No. 4 or 5 role in the NHL in the long-term. He's a project, but the payoff might be worth it."
William Wallinder,"If you're reading this draft guide one profile after the other, then think of MODO defender William Wallinder as similar to Joni Jurmo but slightly worse, at least in our estimation. If you're not reading this draft guide as we'd intended for it to be read, then step right into my office - - it's time to look at Wallinder brings to the table. This kid can really move, and he's a gangly, lanky lad to boot. Wallinder towers over the competition, standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 194 pounds -- there's plenty of room for him to fill out that frame. That's a combo that's always going to bring boys to the yard, where boys to the yard, in this instance, are scouts to 6rnsk6Idsvik arena to watch MODO's J20 SuperElit team play hockey. Depending on what games they attended, these scouts could leave their viewings thinking that Wallinder is a future top-pairing defenceman at the NHL level or a DND-grade (DND stands for Do Not Draft) prospect to avoid this October. That variance shows up well on the EliteProspects 'Draft Center' page, where Wallinder is ranked as high as 18th-overall by one outlet and as low as 57th overall on the low-end of that range. The one constant? Through the good and the bad performances alike - - Wallinder always skates well. He skates well enough that Christoffer Hedlund, our Dir. of European Scouting based in Sweden, made him one of the only players with a 7-grade or higher for skating. ""Wallinder is such an unbelievably smooth skater with a fluid stride,"" Hedlund noted in his year-end player report. ""He might be the most technically skilled skater among all defenceman in this draft. Wallinder uses long strides to gather speed but short-quick strides to navigate through traffic. ""He accelerates very well for a player of Wallinder's size,"" Hedlund continued. ""He'll probably be even faster once he adds more lower-body strength. We haven't seen him at his fastest yet."" Now, if only Wallinder skated with a purpose. Another consistent theme through many of our viewings was an effort level that would make Orange Cassidy beet red... Cassidy. ""Wallinder doesn't compete much in his own zone, can float around, and often looks totally unengaged,"" Hedlund wrote. ""He lacks that burning competitive fire to beat his opponents, whether it's defending the inside lane near the net-front or battling for a puck along the boards - - you rarely, if ever, get a full effort from Wallinder."" The real question is whether one would even notice if Wallinder started applying himself more consistently on a shift-to-shift, night-to-night basis, particularly in the defensive zone. Wallinder's defensive instincts are, regrettably, every bit as poor as his habits. ""He plays a horrendous positional game,"" Hedlund wrote in Wallinder's player report. ""He can be all over his own zone, just wandering aimlessly, looking completely lost, and not covering anyone in particular. ""His decision-making in the defensive zone is just so very, very poor. Wallinder often left the slot completely unattended to chase pucks all the way on the other side of the zone. On other occasions, he was guilty as sin of puck-watching."" As Hedlund notes in many of his game reports, Wallinder isn't much better through the neutral zone, where his exceptional skating should make him an absolute force. He plays far too accommodating a gap, doesn't mitigate risk with his footwork, spaces himself poorly, and commits far too early. It's worth noting that Wallinder improved defensively over the course of the season but not by much. For additional context, MODO's J20 team was a bit of a disaster defensively, and Wallinder didn't look quite as permissive in the Allsvenskan. That's about as complimentary or accommodating as it's going to get for Wallinder's play in the defensive third though. Let's take a step back into the pros column, though, because Wallinder has shown some capability playing in the offensive zone. He's an alright finisher from the point, leaning more on his wrist shot than his slapshot, and showing somecapability with the one-timer. 'There's good accuracy on Wallinder's wrist shot, along with decent power. but it's far from a laser,"" Hedlund wrote. ""Taking a Iittle time off of the release would help him a bit here, both to get those point shots through traffic and to take away time from the goaItender."" Where Wallinder is most productive, though, is on the rush. He's a great puck-carrier, eager to leader his team up the ice, and with a great deal of initiative in creative offensive chances. Barring that, Wallinder is all too happy to join the second-wave as a trailer. The consistency of his passes leave a lot to be desired, but there's no denying the way that he sees the ice. Wallinder has strong offensive instincts, of this much there is no doubt. Ultimately, though, we see the most likely career outcome for Wallinder as a No. 4 or 5 defenceman with puck-moving upside primarily, and offensive value secondarily. The lack of a finishing component really hurts his proJection here, as does his unspectacular in-zone offensive contributions. "
Marat Khusnutdinov,"The cult hero of this year's draft? Why, that would be none other than SKA centre Marat Khusnutdinov, a two-way centre who just kept picking up steam among Real Prospect Heads'"" as the season dragged on. Now, this isn't Revenge of the Sith, and I'm not saying that EliteProspects has become the very thing we swore to destroy (200 hockey men) but we're straying a bit from the collective wisdom of draft twitter on this one. We like Khusnutdinov. When Mitch Brown and J.D. Burke went to Dawson Creek for the World Junior A Challenge, they left feeling pretty damn good about the gritty pivot's game. It's just that we just like Khusnutdinov a little bit less than some of our peers. As strong a performance as Khunutdinov put in that tournament, though, his offensive limitations were abundantly clear - - the same was true of his performance at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in August, too. That's what makes it so hard for us to countenance a first-round grade or even a higher grade in the second-round for Khusnutdinov - - a lack of offensive upside. ""Khusnutdinov doesn't have any deceptive or manipulative abilities in the offensive zone,"" David St-Louis noted in his year-end player report. ""He barely creates for his teammates or even himself off of the cycle or in the moments that follow an entry."" ""Khusnutdinov doesn't bring much offence,"" Mitch Brown noted in a February game report. ""Sure he plays with pace, but what about his shot, off-puck instincts, playmaking, and creativity? He's a simple player, with his offensive decisions using falling into three categories: skate into the corner, quickly, drive the net from an outside burst or speed, or back off the defence and pass in the space behind him. There's not much more there."" Another limiting factor is that Khusnutdinov just isn't much of a finisher, whether we're talking about short, intermediate, or long ranges. He's got clunky shot mechanics, takes low percentage, drive-killing shots, and doesn't place them especially well. You'd think someone with these limitations would be a bit more modest with their shot placement, but Marat has never seen a top-corner he didn't want to attempt to pick. One area where Khusnutdinov has shown a great deal of proficiency is in carrying the puck into the offensive zone. He's a willing east-west attacker once he's gained the blue line, and someone who integrates dotted-line usage and a diversity of rush patterns to create space for himself on the rush. He plays with so much pace too, and not just relative to the MHL but in the context of first-time draft-eligible skaters period. It's almost problematic for Khusnutdinov at the MHL level, where his teammates are often a far ways away from levelling with him - - this was especially true when he teamed up with Alexander Gordin who is a soft 4-grade skater. Whether Khusnutdinov has the hands to transport the puck through the centre lane of the ice himself or not - - he's consistently shown a great deal of bravery thrusting himself into the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone. It's the way Khusnutdinov plays the defensive side of the game that is going to take him places - - that's his bread and butter. He plays the full 200-feet of the ice, with one of the best motors in this class. He'll relentlessly backcheck as play transitions towards the defensive zone, and his ability to track developing plays while he's skating at full speed really impressed us over the course of the year. ""Khusnutdinov plays with a high-motor and constantly pressures the opposition,"" St-Louis wrote. ""He stays above the puck, angles forwards to the boards on backchecks, shoulder checks in-zone to locate off of the puck threats, and intercepts passes regularly. He'll contribute low in the defensive zone, and he always jumps on pucks as they spring loose with reckless abandon."" Now, it wouldn't be fair to Khusnutdinov if I didn't add that we've received some pushback from scouts on the team side about his upside and offensive potential. Our position on Khusnutdinov's offensive skill set is hardly the ubiquitous one. We're nonetheless confident in our evaluation, with countless live viewings and film sessions to inform our position. It's not like Khusnutdinov lit the MHL on fire, and he played on by far its best, most productive team. With his limitations as a distributor and a skater, it's hard to imagine a scenario where Khusnutdinov can hold down a third-line centre's role at the NHL level. If he's playing centre, it will probably be on a fourth-line and on the penalty kilI. The more likely outcome for Khusnutdinov, in our estimation, is that of a detailed, two-way winger that can generate a decent amount of secondary offence on the rush and the counterattack. "
Ty Smilanic,"The next United States National Team Development Program's U18 offering to the EliteProspects Draft Guide is Ty Smilanic, a centre who will, eventually, take his talents to the NCAA's Ouinnipiac Bobcats. This was a bit of a tough year for Smilanic. He struggled early to meet the relatively lofty expectations that carried him into this season, and then suffered a broken finger around the midway point in the year, as reported by EliteProspects Rinkside's Russ Cohen. Oh, and there was a bit of a mini-controversy for Smilanic at about the mid-season point, one which spurred him to de-commit from the University of Denver, and then sign on for Ouinnipiac. Talk about tough sledding. It's that broken finger that makes it especially difficult to evaluate Smilanic's year. On the one hand, 22 points in 34 games is pretty unspectacular; on the other hand, how much better can one do with a broken finger on their shooting hand? Just look at how much Nolan Foote improved from his draft-year to his draft-plus-one season as he recovered from a wrist injury. This stuff matters. The underlying data doesn't offer much clarity either. lnStat's data from the USNTDP U18's season has Smilanic only generating about five expected goals based on the location and frequency of his shots, two short of the number he actually hit. They only have Smilanic down for 44 scoring chances too, which is pretty low considering his ice-time and how it rates among the NTDP. Then again, the data that Mitch Brown manually tracked from the NTDP's season has Smilanic generating expected goals in the 80th percentile at 5-on-5 across his sample of CHL and USNTDP games. There can be no doubt about Smilanic's limitations, as currently constructed. as a distributor. That much is pretty damn clear. ""Questionable vision limited his opportunity to create through his linemates on a few occasions,"" J.D. Burke wrote in a December game report. ""He passed away from an open linemate in the slot, who would have had a glorious one-touch scoring opportunity if Smilanic had gotten him the puck."" There's also the really troubling issue with Smilanic's game where he often overhandles the puck, in spite of not being an especially capable handler in the small-ice game. Not to mention, Smilanic isn't especially active or competent in transitioning the puck up-ice either, in spite of skating pretty damn well. The one thing that's not in question? This kid's toughness. I'm not even sure I'd have it in me to write articles with a broken finger, much less play highly competitive hockey. That's just an extension of Smilanic's unrelenting work ethic. Combined with a plus-skating stride, it's a nice little foundation to build upon as Smilanic looks to elevate his game at the NCAA level. ""His compete level was apparent from whistle to whistle. and he used his speed to make sure that he was keeping involved with the play on both ends of the rink,"" our American scout Joey Padmanabhan remarked in a March game report. ""He competed hard for every puck and used his big frame effectively. engaging physically with opponents along the boards."" You'll not be the least bit surprised to know that Smilanic applies that work ethic and skating well in the defensive zone. ""Smilanic is a complete talent who can be relied on in all situations,"" Padmanabhan wrote in his year-end player report. ""On defence, Smilanic is active and reads plays well. He anticipates passes and can cut them off using his long reach. In defensive zone battles, Smilanic uses his frame efficiently to outmuscle competition and dig pucks out of scrums."" The one area where Smilanic could stand to improve almost across the board is in the way he supports the puck. He often crowds his linemates on breakouts, seems to wander a bit in the offensive zone, and generally finds himself closer to pressure than is often necessary. He's a bit of a wild card in this year's draft. Nothing about Smilanic's draft-year made sense, and nothing about his immediate future does either, since the Bobcats play in the ECAC conference. The long-term play here is probably a supporting role for Smilanic. something akin to a bottom-six checking role with some finishing upside that could prove valuable on a second-unit power play at the NHL level. He's a long ways away from that as presently constructed though. "
Anton Johannesson,"HV71's J20 team was an offensive buzzsaw in the J20 SuperElit, and Anton Johannesson was their best point-getting rearguard. You read that right. His 24 points (eight goals and 16 assists) in 20 games give him a big edge in points per game rate-scoring. The data that InStat collected from the J20 SuperElit's season has Johannesson leading the team with five passes to the slot, one higher than the next highest skater, Emil Andrae, in spite of playing about 350 fewer minutes. Johannesson's distribution of even strength points (15 at even strength and nine on the power play) are more even than Andrae's (18 at even strength and 20 on the power play), too. Hell, never mind just HV71's J20 team -- Johannesson led the entire Swedish J20 circuit in primary points per game at even strength among first-time draft-eligible defenders with 0.45 per outing. Not bad, right? Right. He's such a creative distributor from within the offensive zone. Johannesson's four-way mobility and layered deception make it easy for him to open up passing lanes with which to strike and hit his teammates in glorious scoring positions. His vision is at such a high level, too. ""Johannesson has a good mix of creative, deceptive passes, and simple effective ones in the offensive zone. Whatever works,"" Christoffer Hedlund, our Dir. of European Scouting, wrote in his year-end player report. ""He really takes advantage of his mobility to open up passing lanes and ruthlessly exploits them."" He's constantly moving his feet, activating off of the point, and joining the team's cycle off of the puck. Johannesson's proficiency on the forehand and backhand combined with a lethal one-touch passing game make him a real weapon in these spots, too. Shifting gears away from the offensive zone - - this is a defender, right? - - let's move one-third back into the neutral zone. While we haven't necessarily seen Johannesson dominate defending the blue line in a projectable way, he's produced some pretty stellar numbers preventing controlled entries against. ""He handles 1-on-1defending situations really well because of his four-way mobility,"" Hedlund wrote. ""Then when the opposition dumps the puck into the offensive zone, he does a good job on retrievals, shoulder checking as he collects the puck, then quickly and decisively acting once it's on his stick."" Then things change for Johannesson drastically during sustained in-zone defensive possessions. He starts to look far less competent. It starts with Johannesson's size; there just aren't many competent 18-year-old, 5-foot-9 defenders. Learning how to defend at that size is a process, and it's one that he's still working through. ""He reaIly struggles with the physicaI part of the game due to a lack of size and strength,"" Hedlund wrote. ""He tries to work around this by using his stick or playing smart positional hockey, but that can only compensate to such a degree. This is a really big problem for Johannesson along the boards and in front of his net. ""Granted, there is a lot of room for Johannesson to grow within his frame, so this could get better with time. He'll always be an undersized player though."" The other thing to note is that Johannesson has lost a fair amount of time to injury, which doubtless cost him opportunities to hit the gym, fill out physically, etc. Hopefully, he'll play with a clean bill of health in his draft-plus-one year and that'll do wonders for his physical development. This is a case where the boxcar really does lend itself well to the player archetype - - Johannesson is a pure offensive defenceman, with credibility as a puck-mover, and significant, potentially critical shortcomings in the defensive zone. Whether Johannesson can work those flaws out or not is going to take a while to determine. He's a bit of a project. There's no teaching the sort of offensive vision this kid has though - - that's rare! If Johannesson can stay healthy, fill outhis5-foot-9 frame, learn how to better defend at his size, and just build on the strengths already present in his game, then there's a chance that he could be a second or third-pairing option in the NHL with value on a second-unity power play. "
Wyatt Kaiser,"There's a decent chance you're fairly familiar with our next subject, Andover Huskies defenceman Wyatt Kaiser, in spite of his playing in a fairly low visibility setting - - American high school - - for the majority of his year. It started with the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia and Slovakia, where Kaiser played pretty high in the lineup on the American 8-Team (they don't send the United States National Team Development Program U18 squad to that tournament). Even though Kaiser didn't generate a ton (read: any) offence through the USA's five games in the tournament: he acquitted himself fairly well from a two-way perspective. Then Kaiser joined the Dubuque Fighting Saints for the USHL Fall Classic and stuck around for another nine games, registering three assists in a bottom-pairing role before heading for greener pastures and more playing time with the Huskies. On the one hand, it would've been nice to see Kaiser play in the USHL for the entire season - - there's no doubt of that. Traditionally, drafting from American high schools can prove a perilous, fraught venture. The advancement of draft analytics in recent years have shed even more light on this. On the other hand, Kaiser got so much more playing time and the opportunity to develop playing for Andover. The Fighting Saints were one of the USHL's best teams, and they had an unbelievably deep blue line. Full marks to Kaiser for reading the tealeaves. He's such a smooth, smooth skater. That's the part of Kaiser's game that is going to take him to the promised land. ""Kaiser is a standout skater in many regards - - his straight line separation speed is excellent,"" Daniel Gee, one of our film scouts, wrote about Kaiser in his player report. ""His edge work and ability to maneuver in tight spaces offers him a great deal of escapability under pressure. He employs stutter steps and the mohawk skating techniques to create deception. He can stop and start on a dime. freezing aggressive forecheckers on the point. He's smooth and very upright. Great use of crossovers to create power on the rush. Shows to be very strong due to how upright he is able to keep his body. Good knee-bend and presents powerful recoveries on various shifts."" Kaiser's strength as a skater informs every part of his game, starting with how he breaks the puck out from the offensive zone. He's one of the rare defenders in this year's draft that can make forecheckers look like they're skating in quicksand. The credible threat that Kaiser presents as a skater when he's breaking the puck out of the defensive zone really opens things up for him as a passer, too. He's shown a real proficiency stretching the ice, sometimes completing two or three-line passes. Gee summed this up well in his year-end Kaiser player report. ""Kaiser can make pinpoint breakout passes with quickness. He's accurate in hitting his forwards tape and increasing the pace of Andover's transition game. His head is always up, and he's very calm under forechecking pressure; it never really affects his passing accuracy. Keeps passing plays relatively simple. Has a sophisticated understanding of bank passes; he uses angles expertly. He consistently displays a great awareness of his teammates' positions."" There's no shyness on Kaiser's part to join the rush or lead the rush into the offensive zone, too. Worst-case scenario, he's going to avail himself of every opportunity to present himself as a trailing option in the second-wave of the attack. Where Kaiser really distinguishes himself is in his willingness to drive the centre lane, tie up sticks, and even crash the net when the moment calls for it. Once the Huskies establish offensive zone time, Kaiser's contributions diminished a bit. He just doesn't get a lot of pop on his wrist shot, in part because he keeps his hands so damn high on his stick, limiting the amount of torque he can generate on his wrist shot wind ups. Kaiser doesn't have much of a slap shot or a one-timer at his disposal either. True to his namesake, he attacks in much the same way that the Germans tried to open things up on the western front, employing a Kaiserschlacht-type of volume approach. Much like the Kaiserschlacht, it's not a foolproof approach by any means, and Kaiser often suffers his indiscretion. ""Kaiser is liable for one or two big mistakes per game -- mistakes that typically shouldn't happen,"" Gee wrote. ""Usually the cause is turnovers in his own zone from falling down, or allowing a player to get behind him. Often will let opposing players into the crease area."" That's not all that uncommon among high school players with high-end draft potential - - they have a tendency to try things that they wouldn't even dream of in higher-tiers of competition. Kaiser, who is committed to Minnesota-Duluth for the 2020-21season, is going to need to iron out the big mistakes quickly, lest he get exposed in a big way against NCAA competition. There's a strong foundation in place, though, and Kaiser could potentially leverage his skating, offensive instincts, and puck-moving credentials into a second-pairing role at the NHL if he develops well."
Emil Andrae,"Do not - - I repeat, do not! - - underestimate HV71offensive defenceman Emil Andrae because of his 5-foot-9 frame or his playing style. That would be acritical mistake on your part. It's not the size of the dog in the fight; it's the size of the fight in the dog, right? And there's a lot of fight in this dog. Whether it's the gaudy point totals he amassed in the J20 SuperElit team (38 points in 40 games) or the SHL's grown men that found themselves seeing stars - - Andrae's bite often leaves a mark. One of those skills is more transferable than the other; I'm sure you don't need me to spell this one out, but I'II humour you anyway. ""Andrae plays with a high work-rate when the puck is close, and does whatever he can once he has committed to winning a puck-battle,"" our Dir. of European Scouting Christoffer HedIund wrote in his year-end player report. ""He really likes to play a physical, gritty style, and throw the body, but how efficient wilI that be in the NHL when the size disadvantage and physical disadvantage is more profound?"" This, of course, wouId be of less concern to us if not for the fact that the other components of Andrae's game in the defensive zone - - the ones that don't revolve around his physicality - - aren't at nearly a high enough level to project to the NHL with any confidence either. The way that Andrae defends through the neutral zone is especially concerning, because this is where the size disadvantage isn't as much of as an issue at is in the defensive zone itself. The playing field won't get any more level. ""Andrae has weak stickwork in his own zone, and while defending his blue line,"" Hedlund wrote. ""It's improved slightly in his own zone during the season but it's still of concern at the blue line."" ""He does not his manage gap control well; he's often too passive or just makes a straight-line rush towards the puck which makes him vulnerable to side-movements or dump ins."" Then, of course, there are Andrae's shortcomings from within the defensive zone, and they are legion. He's guilty as sin of puck-watching, doesn't move his feet when he closes on an opponent opting instead to glide towards them, and his off of the puck reads often miss the mark. ""Andrae is suspect to poor decision-making in his own zone. He often wants to play with aggression and doesn't always make smart reads; he needs to play with more intelligence and less aggression. He's also way too focused on the puck. He doesn't move his feet enough when the puck isn't nearby, making him easy to beat on the outside if challenged with speed. He should stay more mobile to better prepare for players changing directions and to be able to adjust to his surroundings. This a11seems to be heavily connected to the fact that he is too focused on the puck."" Here's what we like about Andrae though - - his play in the offensive zone. There are some projectable elements within that part of his game, more so than any other. ""Andrae walks the line well to open shooting lanes from the point, using his edges and body in an evasive way,"" Hedlund wrote. ""He often postures himself in offensive positions playing off of the puck in the offensive zone, which puts him closer to the net for shooting opportunities than he'd otherwise be if he were stapled to the blue line. ""He's got excellent vision from the point, and can make great plays to set up his teammates with high-danger chances."" There's a wide array of offensive weapons at Andrae's disposal. There's his off of the puck skating patterns, the way that he sees the ice, and also, his hands. Andrae is a phenomenal puck-handler, one who sets up his maneuvers well with deceptive signals through his body language, and with a ton of confidence at that. ""Andrae loves to stickhandle and to challenge opponents 1-on-1,"" Hedlund remarked in his year-end report. ""It's hard to read or predict for opponents. ""He's a great puck handling for a defenceman, looks fantastic while playing against junior players when he can dictate the pace but in the SHL (when the pace is consistently high) he has had some trouble at times."" Then there's the shot. Well, the shots might be a bit more apt. Andrae brings a fully-formed arsenal, with all the accoutrements, and a some well-honed discretion about when to use what. He's got a good wrist shot, slap shot, one-timer - - you name it. His preference is for the quick release wrist shot, one that Andrae often sends on net as soon as it's landed on his stick. The other, final concern that we have with Andrae's game, and it's one that helps explain our ranking process considering the other tools, is that he's just not a good enough skater as currently constructed to play his game at higher levels of hockey. This was already abundantly clear at the SHL level, where the pace often proved to be too much for Andrae. He's got an average acceleration, and an average top-speed, and that's pretty damning for someone who attacks so consistently through straight lines rather than in an arc. There is a lot in Andrae's game that needs a lot of work. There is no denying that much. There's also the potential for a pretty decent pay-off, especially relative to where we think he should go in the draft. If the team that drafts Andrae handles his development welI, and he matches their effort, then the possibility exists for a puck-moving. second-pairing defenceman that can bring a fair amount of value to the offensive zone.

Tristen Robins,"When you're talking about which Saskatoon Blades forward led the way during the 2019-20 season, it's no longer Tristen Robins: it's Tri-Stan Robins, thank you very much. Done groaning? Alright, moving on then. If there's any one WHLer that gave Portland Winterhawks forward Seth Jarvis a run for their money with the best second-half of the season - - it's Robens. Through the first half of the season and its 31games, Robens amassed nine goals and 12 assists; he caught fire right around the 32nd game of the season, and scored 24 goals and added 28 helpers in the back-nine. Granted, Robins played about a minute more in estimated ice-time per game, according to our good friends at Pick224.com, and he's also an early birthdate, but that's why Robins is in our second-round and not our first. Well, part of the reason, anyway. Even though Robins is far more of a playmaker than a shooter, the thing that really stands out in his game is the way that he anticipates play and outsmarts his opponents at every turn. ""Robins has such a refined offensive mind,"" J.D.Burke wrote in a March game report. ""There are so many little subtle ways for one to add value to his team at every end of the ice, and most players at this age are only aware of maybe half of these items. Whether it's taking smart routes off of the puck in support of his team's transition to draw opponents out of space or making himself available -- Robins is working smart as much as he's working hard."" There's ample amounts of skill to complement Robins often times overwhelming offensive instincts. He's a gifted puck-handler, capable of blending pass receptions into highly-detailed maneuvers, and freezing his opponents with deceptive elements at every turn. ""Robins blends pass receptions with stickhandling, fakes, and dekes for streamlined transition attacks,"" Mitch Brown. our Dir. of North American Scouting, wrote in Robins' year-end player report. ""His top hand is free to move across the body, giving him the flexibility to move the puck in any direction without concern of a mishandle. He evades defenders with ease with a variety of around and triangle dekes. He commits weight to fakes (more convincing) which allows him to manipulate the feet and sticks of defenders with certain ease, and he's imaginative with an ever-expanding arsenal of moves."" It will come as no surprise then that Robins' underlying goal results are pretty spectacular almost right across the board. Robins lands in the 91st percentile generating expected goals per hour and shots per hour, both at 5-on-5. in the data that Brown collected from the CHL and the USNTDPU18 squad last season. ""Robins built an angle-changing component into his wrist shot, with added blade deception,"" Brown wrote. ""He shoots off of either foot (preferred is outside foot though) with several weight shifts. He shoots with against the grain placement and shoots all over the net. He also seeks out pressure to use as screens, and maintains shot power, and accuracy through contact."" The data that our partners at InStat Hockey collected from the Blades' season has Robins generating 29 goals, only four short of his actual output, which is unusual for someone who scores this often. Usually, there's something of a disconnect there, one which helps illustrate the potency of one's shot; I'd like to think that Robins relatively similar mark is a testament to his intelligence and habits as a finisher. Likewise, I've found that the underlying data illustrates some of Robins' strengths as a distributor that might not have otherwise been obvious. lnStat has Robins leading the Blades with 48 passes to the slot. Meanwhile, Brown's data set shows that whatever Robins lacks for passing volume, he more than makes up for with quality. Even so, Brown identified Robins' playmaking as a component of his game that could use a little work. ""He's a technically refined passer who can make high-skill passes, but doesn't look for teammates, instead throwing out hope passes. Robins has a limited awareness of teammates' positioning around the ice, and his transition passes often end up behind the intended target. He's just very individualistic through transition period."" That bears out in Brown's data, where Robins rates fairly lowly, almost right across the board, in transition, whether it's zone entries or zone exits at 5-on-5. Then again, players that skate like Robins aren't generally leaders in-transition. He's got an explosive first two steps. but his long-track speed isn't noteworthy, and it's hard to imagine him having enough small-ice quickness at the next level as currently constructed. His mechanics are actually mostly fine, and he's fairly physically developed, too. He plays at such a high effort level, too. There isn't an obvious path forward in his development as a skater. This, of course, makes his projection a difficult one. More difficult than most players, if I'm being honest. The way that Robins can shoot the puck, handle the puck, and support the puck in the offensive zone is pretty rare for a first-time draft-eligible skater. There's a foundation of skills that could propel him to a lengthy, fruitful NHL career, certainly. It's just hard to imagine what the next steps in his development look like. Robins' skill set probably translates better to the wing at the NHL level, but his offensive explosion primarily came as a centre last season. The area where he most needs to grow doesn't appear to have much room for growth. It's a very uncertain projection. Ultimately, we think Robins could develop into a top-nine winger with second-unit power play utility, with some substantial development, of course. "
Justin Sourdif,"We've seen so many different versions of Vancouver Giants winger Justin Sourdif over the last two seasons. The Sourdif that we saw in his 16-year-old, WHL rookie season had first-round pick written all over him. His work rate was through the roof on a shift-to-shift, game-to-game basis, and he matched it with his production and skill. We hoped to see more of that from him this season, and we did... in February. Sourdif went on an absolute tear, putting up17 points in 11games, and looking the part too. This wasn't a percentage-driven mirage; this was Sourdif reminding us just how good he can be. Mostly, though, Sourdif frustrated the hell out of our staff this season. The work rate that helped define his draft-minus-one season seemed to just...disappear. It happened pretty much right off the hop too - - right at the unofficial beginning of the scouting season. Sourdif underwhelmed at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia, and that was just a sign of things to come. That pattern followed for the next few months with his hometown Vancouver Giants. ""Last season's non-stop motor is gone,"" Mitch Brown. our Alberta-based Dir. of North American scouting wrote in his year-end report. ""The flashes of high-end skill remain but are no more frequent than last season. I have legitimate questions about the lack of progression despite playing in a favourable environment."" So, what did we see from Sourdif? There are some pretty high-end tools in his toolkit; that much has never been in doubt. The best of those tools is Sourdif's shot. With his hands well out in front for the release and high-end dexterity, Sourdif generates a good deal of power without taking too much time on the windup. ""Sourdif has a powerful, hands-in-front release with occasional crafty placement - - he's a legitimate long-range threat when he shoots."" Brown noted. ""He has a variety of shots - - a wrist, snap, two-touch, backhand-forehand transitions - - at his disposal, too."" The best shooters know how to tilt the odds in their favour, and Sourdif brings that quality in spades. His off of the puck skating patterns, timing, and a nose for soft ice put him in the best position to wield that shot to its fullest potential. ""He anticipates and supports the offence by occupying passing lanes, with constant movement, and well-timed cuts to escape pressure into the slot,"" Brown wrote. ""His 'quick' release interaction with off-puck instincts should lead to goal-scoring explosion next season."" That would go a long way towards explaining how Sourdif showed in the 96th percentile in expected goals generated per hour at 5-on-5 based on the sample of data that Brown collected from the CHL and the NTDP last season. Then there's Sourdif's skating, which helped form the foundation of his strong draft-minus-one season. While Sourdif lacks a straight-line separation gear over distance, his high activity rate helps cover. Without that activity rate, it might be another story. He's a tremendously athletic player, with small-ice quickness to escape puck retrievals and battles with haste and conviction. He skates with a low centreof gravity too, which allows him to bulldoze through traffic. The best way to look at this is that there's a clear pathway to improvement for Sourdif mechanically; it's not outside the realm of possibiIity that he develops the sort of straight- Iine separation gear that his game presently lacks. ""His recovering leg doesn't return fully underneath the torso cylinder, flaring slightly outside, leading to a lack of power generation because of the wide starting point on initial push,"" Brown observed. ""He has an inconsistent extension, consistent with a lack of physical maturity."" Similarly, there is room for Sourdif to grow, significantly, as a decision-maker with the puck on his stick. He lands on both sides of the same coin, one cast by an inability to problem-solve against complex defensive arrangements; Sourdif is either excruciatingly indecisive or tries to force plays where they don't exist. This evaluation was one of the more difficult ones that we had to make this year. So much of what made us enthusiastic about Sourdif as a can't-miss first-round pick going into this year evaporated, and that left us to wonder why, whether last year's showing was a mirage, etc. It's not like he got worse, necessarily, but he sure as shit didn't get much better. Every projection, particularly at this part of the draft, is fraught with chaIIenges though. Sourdif is hardly the exception on that front. With all of those lengthy qualifiers out of the way. Sourdif projects as a top-nine winger with the ability to contribute in both phases of special teams at the NHL level. "
Jean-Luc Foudy,"It's not often that the clearcut best skater in the draft finds themselves barely clinging to the second-round, but that just happens to be the case for Windsor Spitfires centre Jean-Luc Foudy. That might be generous too, relative to where Foudy will go in October. It only takes one team to make him a first-round pick but the conversations we've shared with scouts and executives on the team side has us slamming the under. This wasn't always the case. We came into the year with sky-high expectations for Foudy. His skating caught everyone's attention last season, and J.D. Burke left the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup in Czechia with really strong impressions of the Windsor product. ""While Foudy didn't make his impact felt on the scoresheet (one shot in 15:56 of ice time) his presence was noticeable every shift,"" Burke wrote in August. ""Foudy was hard on the puck, unrelenting in pursuit, and brought it at both ends of the ice."" ""What stuck out most was Foudy's four-way mobility. He's elusive as a puck-carrier and can operate in confined spaces with relative ease. Combined with strong puck skills, Foudy was a lot to handle for the Finns on Monday."" All of this helped inform Foudy's position as the 24th-ranked skater on our first board, published in November. That, and the belief that he had so much more to give than he'd shown to that point in the season. There are voices in our staff that still hold this opinion; that Foudy has the potential to be one of the ten-best players in this class if he puts everything together. They're far fewer and far less enthusiastic now than they were in November, and therein lies the problem. Not only was there a lack of progress from Foudy; one might reasonably argue that his game took a step back in some respects. Certainly, a cursory glance at Foudy's boxcars bears out a pretty convincing argument. He went from 49 points in 63 games as a 16-year-old to 43 points in 59 games in his draft-year. Now, the interesting question, and one that NHL teams are going to have to ponder, is to what extent Foudy's environment conspired against him in his first season of draft-eligibility. That's the most compelling argument against his stagnation; that Windsor's environment suffocated the elements of Foudy's game that once made him such a dynamic centre. The first item to note is that the team as a whole struggled. Short is the list of players who excelled offensively in Windsor last season (maybe Yegor Afanasyev, if we're being loose with our verbiage here). The second one is that Foudy's linemates just...didn't move. Whether it was Will Cuylle, Cole Purboo, Daniel D'Amico or the aforementioned Afanasyev - - his linemates were agonizingly static. Foudy would circle the offensive zone for minutes at a time. waiting. hoping, praying for a teammate to attach the soft-ice that his skating opened and... nothing. ""Still, I can't help but watch the way Foudy weaves in and out of the neutral and offensive zones and wonder if he'd do better with more mobile linemates,"" Burke remarked in a December game report. ""One can see the wheel turning in Foudy's mind, but as he opens a passing lane with a quick pivot or a deceptive move on the puck, none of his linemates enter the breach."" Does Foudy's scoring drastically improve in a different environment? I mean, maybe? At the very least, one has to account for the possibility. Here's what no environment, nor any scout, can take away from Foudy - - his skating. ""Foudy's ability to get to top speed from a standstill and beat guys clean up the ice is elite. Skating is easily his best attribute,"" our OHL scout, Rachel Doerrie, wrote in a player report this season. ""Once he gets to top speed. he effortlessly maintains it, leading to drawn penalties or high-danger scoring chances. He doesn't support the puck in the best spots, but he skates himself out of trouble on a nightly basis."" The other detail to Foudy's skating is the way that he uses a wide array of rush patterns through the neutral zone - - including integration of the dotted line - - to create space for himself. Space that, frankly, he might not even need to begin with: it doesn't hurt to have it though As one might imagine, this makes Foudy a lethal force in-transition; a one-man zone entry machine. The data that Mitch Brown tracked from the CHL and USNTDP U18 in the 2019-20 season bears that out in a massive way Foudy generates the most successful offensive zone entries with control of the puck per hour of anyone in the sample, at 5-on-5. If only Foudy had shown more capability creating off of the rush; it's not like he didn't get the reps. He's got a nasty tendency to hang onto the puck for far too long, over-handling it away from obvious passing options, and then eventually trying to jailbreak his linemates with low percentage area passes. Foudy's worst habit of all - - and perhaps the most correctable one, too - - is his propensity to lower his head in the face of even the most modest pressure. The more challenging fix for Foudy will be convincing him to play with a little more bravery; to attack the centre lane with more conviction rather than defaulting to the perimeter every time he has the puck in the offensive zone. That's going to be a tall order, but it's an absolutely crucial component of his development that needs work. Interestingly. even with these legion shortcomings, Foudy seems to generate underlying offence at an impressive rate. Foudy is in the 99th percentile for generating expected assists and the 97th percentile for shot assists. both at 5-on-5, based on the sample of data Brown collected. Meanwhile, lnStat's data shows Foudy completing the highest volume of passes to the slot on the Spitfires, one higher than the next highest skater in Windsor. This was a brutally difficult evaluation for our staff. Perhaps the most difficult one we faced all season. It's one thing to be confounded as group but it's another entirely when the debate on where to rank a player is so fierce. The one thing everyone at EliteProspects agreed upon is that Foudy, more so than any other prospect in this draft, needs to go to a team with a strong track record of developing players. He's a project, but if a team can harness the best parts of Foudy's game and work out the bad habits, it's a project worth undertaking."
Joel Blomqvist,"Not one Finnish goaltender crossed the stage at last year's draft - - and even with Tuukka Rask, Pekka Rinne, Juuse Saros, and Antti Raanta holding their places firm in the NHL, it was hard to see much optimism about the future of the plucky Nordic nation in the crease. Joel Blomqvist is proof that last year was likely just a blip, though, and he's well on pace to be the successor to Justus Annunen as the most exciting Finnish goaltender available. He grew up playing in Vaasan Sport's junior program, but has since moved to arguably one of Finland's most powerful goaltending pipelines behind Annunen himself - - and he's getting a nice combination of good defense and high-quality hockey with Liiga's Karpat to aid his development before he inevitably makes his way over to North America. Some Finnish goaltenders make their mark on scouts by being flashy and acrobatic, but Blomqvist plays a quiet, composed game that looks smart and confident. He doesn't second-guess himself often, and seems to have great spatial awareness; in viewings of him playing both at the international level and over in Finland, he doesn't overshoot his destinations often and seems to have a solid grasp on how to read and anticipate plays. His tracking looks smooth, like he's following along with the play rather than trying to catch up to it, and he recovers from his rebounds welI. He's got all the marks of a Finnish-developed goaltender, with an active glove hand that he's not afraid to use and an explosive first push when moving laterally across the crease - - but he doesn't often have to overcorrect or recover from bad plays, especially when facing his own age-appropriate peers. It can often be easy to try jumping ahead to gauge how a goaltender looks, but as a draft-eligible he's displayed fantastic development and seems to be well-situated to keep improving. His game draws parallels to Annunen's from the 2018 draft, but with a little more power and longevity to his play over the course of a full game. Finnish goaltenders tend to develop by playing a depth management system that puts them at the top of the crease and watches them move inwards in the wake of oncoming offensive opportunities. This 'outside-in' style works well on larger rinks in Europe, where there's more time for skaters and shooters to consider passing options and more space for plays to get set up; it gives the goaltender extra time to utilize extra space. But in North America, some of these more 'aggressive' goaltenders have gotten burned in recent years, spawning a shift back to a more conservative style of depth management that pushes out from a starting point along the goal line. Blomqvist thrives in Finland right now, but would need to showcase better conservation with his depth if and when he does make it over to North America. His skating and reaction speed are also stilljust a step behind Askarov, and his decision-making when playing faster opponents shows that he's still very much a goaltender in development. Not necessarily a red flag, but it's clear that he will need more seasoning - - both in Europe and at the AHL level - - before he ultimately stands out for consideration as an NHL goaltender. "
Dmitri Rashevsky,"Discovering MHK Dynamo St. Petersburg winger Dmitri Rashevsky was a fun, fun process. Most of the players we scout come with a long, well-established track record. We're not unearthing talent most of the time, so much as we're scouting these players to get our read on them. If that makes sense? This was different. David St-Louis, our QMJHL scout, was doing some crossover scouting, watching Russian prospects in the MHL, the KHL, and the VHL, with a short list of players we needed reports for. Then David approaches us in our Slack channel, ""has anyone seen this Dmitri Rashevsky? Can I get some additional eyes on him?"" And we were off. J.D.Burke checked the film. Then Mitch Brown checked the film. Then Cam Robinson checked the film. Then Christoffer Hedlund checked the film. Everyone left their viewings impressed, and we've got more game reports for Rashevsky than some of our first-round prospects for the trouble. You won't find Rashevsky accounted for anywhere else on the EliteProspects 'Draft Center' page. It really seems like St-Louis stumbled onto something of a hidden gem. So, what did our staff like so much about this draft-plus-one Russian who rose from obscurity to the end of the second-round on our board? Well, honestly, just about everything. There aren't any real glaring weaknesses in Rashevsky's game. He's a 5-grade in every one of the tools we account for, save for his puck handling, which checks out as a 6-grade. There's no waste in Rashevsky's game. Every component serves the next one. He uses the threat of his shot to set up his passes, and vice versa; he blends layered deception with false signals through his body language in the small-ice game. Everything is so calculated, and often times carried out with ruthless efficiency. ""He constantly look offs and deceives opponents with his eyes before dekes, shots, and passes,"" St-Louis wrote in his May player report. ""He consistently makes intentions with body fakes and stick waves, and integrates fake shots into passes, fake passes into shots, and fakes shots and passes into dekes."" There are, of course, some limitations present in Rashevsky's shot. The most notable one is the lack of variety. Rashevsky's wrist shot can do a lot of damage - - and it often did last season - - but he lacks a one-timer or a slap shot as currently constructed. ""He shoots out of a variety of foot placements and weight shifts with a consistently quick release,"" Brown wrote in Rashevsky's year-end player report. ""He wields crafty placement shooting low and against the grain, and his shot maintains quickness, power, and placement with pressure."" The best of Rashevsky's tools in the offensive zone are his puck skills - - he's a gifted handler of the puck. Rashevsky plays with such intensity, always driving towards the centre lane, and willingly absorbing the contact that comes with it to produce. ""Rashevsky blends deception with smooth, controlled touch and a willingness to keep the puck out defenders' reach,"" St-Louis wrote in a year-end player report. ""He uses one-touch and backhand reactionary dangles; vast arsenal of moves with creativity; hand-eye coordination and effort to problem-solve failed moves; works the triangle but doesn't lean too hard on it; hands syncopated to feet, adding additional layers of deception."" As St-Louis notes, these skills make Rashevsky especially lethal in the small-ice game. ""Rashevsky recognizes his quickness limitations; works the give-and-go and passing triangles; rarely overhandles in traffic, opting to locate teammate."" This package of skills made Rashevsky one of the MHL's most lethal scorers. He finished second only to Stas Petrosyan in the league with 74 points (44 goals and 30 assists) in 61 games; good for a 26-point lead on the next highest scorer on his team. The question that I'm sure is on everyone's mind is what extent playing in the MHL boosted Rashevsky's bottom-line. It's a worthwhile question, too1 That league is, frankly, a bit of a mess. It's hard to say; that's my way of saying, we're not entirely sure ourselves. These concerns are especially salient considering Rashevsky's advanced age as a draft re-entry. That's why he's at the bottom of our second-round and not the first though; it's called hedging one's bets. Much like our guide's last subject, Rashevsky is going to need to find the right home to maximize his potential. He's in a tough spot in Dynamo St.Petersburg, limited to the VHL because they, well, lack a KHL team. Under normal circumstances, we'd advise in favour of whichever team drafts Rashevsky transplanting him to their AHL team post-haste. That's not really an option though. If this last season is any indication, Rashevsky might have already outgrown the VHL, too. Still, it's a worthwhile gamble at this stage of the draft. Rashevsky can skate well, has a high-motor, a good shot, and a really well-rounded offensive toolkit. He could develop into a dual-threat, two-way winger in some team's top-nine, and I'm willing to bet he'll be available far later than we have him on our board. "
Cross Hanas,"Portland Winterhawks winger Cross Hanas is one of the most divisive players in this year's draft. Sometimes, it seems like the scouts and executives on the team side are trying to throw us off the scent; that's probably because they are, sometimes. Hanas represents one such occasion for us this season. It wasn't just a difference of opinion. It seemed like we were watching a completely different player. Take that bit of information however you please. Where our staff saw an scrawny winger with a lot of bite and a real knack for the game within the game; scouts that we spoke to saw someone who shied away from physical play and wasn't willing to take a hit to make a play. ""Hanas keeps his feet moving off of the puck and isn't shy about going to battle on offensive zone puck retrievals,"" J.D.Burke wrote in a March 8th game report. ""He wasn't afraid of taking the puck to the middle of the ice, and plays with a good sense of gravity that allows him to draw defenders towards him and create space for his linemates. All the scouts I talk to call Hanas soft, but he was an eager combatant along the boards in this game and did his business primarily in the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone."" Maybe this is a case of sampling variance? Maybe we're just horribly wrong? We'll get our answer in time. It's something our scouts saw from Hanas at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup all the way through to the end of his season in Portland though. Another thing we saw from Hanas? Someone who consistently displayed an ability to get his teammates the puck in prime positions to score. ""Hanas doesn't instinctually look pass, but finds the trailer, cross-slot opportunities, and players from behind the net,"" Mitch Brown, our Dir. of North American Scouting, wrote in his year-end report. ""He's improved dramatically since playing on the fourth line. He uses a dangerous lane-altering spin-pass that should have success at higher levels."" This bears out in Brown's data, too. Hanas checks in at the 94th percentile generating shot assists per hour at 5-on-5; he's in the 68thpercentile generating expected assists per hour, also at 5-on-5, though. The data that InStat collected from the Winterhawks season paints Hanas' contributions in a pretty favourable way, too. He's second on the team with 15 passes to the slot, seven behind the team-leader Seth Jarvis, but withabout100 fewer minutes played and with a much lower quality of linemates. The way that Hanas sets up many of these passes is what's most impressive. It sometimes seems like he seeks out contact, skating towards defenders to draw them into his orbit, then dishing the puck to a linemate right at the moment of truth to set them up in soft-ice with a chance to score. He can find the trailer, and he's such a dextrous puck handler. The whole ice is available to Hanas anytime the puck is on his stick. Now, about those pucks skills - - Hanas' are near the top of this class. He's such a gifted, creative puck handler, particularly in the small-ice game. ""Hanas is a wonderful stickhandler with unique touch,"" Brown wrote. ""He rolls the wrists up and over the stick to add extra flash to his moves; quick roll-out-the-back touch; regularly dangles goaltenders and defenders."" ""He makes simple moves flashy without inviting unnecessary risk; he finds teammates in scoring areas; and he gets himself to scoring areas in a large number of ways."" One of the real problems with Hanas is that he's such a one-zone player. His hideous skating mechanics limit him so much as a primary puck-carrier going into the offensive zone, and his predictably only makes matters worse - - Hanas loves to buttonhook once he's crossed the blue line. ""Hanas skates with a heel-kick characteristic of a short stride, with a wide stride recovery, and over-reliance on strides over crossovers limits open-ice speed,"" Brown wrote. Granted, to Hanas' credit, he plays within his limitations as a puck-carrier through the neutral zone and doesn't force plays. That might help explain his relatively decent showing in Brown's dataset as a transition piece. There are a lot of questions with Hanas' game. Can he add a shooting component to his game? Would Hanas produce more if he'd played higher in the lineup more regularly? Is there enough substance to go with the flash? Will his skating be good enough at the next level? Only time will tell. He's shown some pretty high-end hockey sense at times though and can stick handle in a phone booth. Those are some pretty desirable qualities. He's also a real shit-disturber sometimes. Under the right circumstances, Hanas could develop into a bottom-six winger with some sandpaper to his game. "
Brett Berard,"There are analytics darlings, and then there's Brett Berard, the 5-foot-9 winger for the United States National Team Development Program's U18 roster. There's the height thing. Draft Twitter loves nothing more than an undersized scoring winger, and Berard is undeniably that. He's also the14th-best point producer in this year's draft once one looks at his production through the SEAL-adjusted (Situational Era Age League) scoring model. How does he do it? Berard is your prototypical dual-threat scorer. Hell, he's a triple-threat scorer if one accounts for his most dangerous weapon -- his puck skills. ""I like how there's no hesitation in his game,"" Mitch Brown wrote in a December game report. ""He sees an opportunity to shoot, pass, or support, and he immediately acts. He's a dual-threat attacker with a bit of skilI beyond the offence."" He's got such a good foundation. Berard makes sure that his elbow isn't in on his body. He layers deception through false signals sent to the opposition with his eyes and through his body language. He works the puck through the defensive triangle. Then there's the stuff one can't easily explain; skills that transcend a checklist. At a certain point, one has to just throw their hands up. Real recognize real, as the kids would say. ""Berard packs high-octane offensive talent into a 5-foot-9 package,"" Joey Padmanabhan, our American scout, wrote in Berard's year-end player report. ""He has a penchant for finding outlets with speed through the neutral zone while also possessing the ability to gain depth in the offensive zone himself. Off the rush, Berard keeps himself involved in the play by finding pockets of space where he can either receive a pass or bang home a rebound."" That handling allows Berard to weave around and sometimes through defenders, and into the most sensitive parts of the ice. That is borne out nicely by the data that Brown collected from the USNTDP U18 and CHL in the 2019-20 season. Based on Brown's sample, Berard is a 92nd percentile producer of expected goals per hour at 5-on-5. ""One wonders how Berard isn't an even more prolific scorer,"" J.D. Burke wondered in a game report from December 28th. ""The skill package is there, particularly in his hands, which allowed him to fearlessly weave through traffic high in the offensive zone effectively"" ""What jumped off the page about Berard in this game was his slippery, mobile skating and offensive drive,"" Christoffer Hedlund, our Dir. of European Scouting, observed from the 5 Nations tournament. ""He took charge with the puck several times and worked hard to make things happen with the puck. He showed good, quick first steps and used that to reach centre ice when he had the puck along the boards."" While Berard isn't the fleetest of foot -- we've got him down as a 6-grade skater, which is above average--, he more than makes up for that with small-ice quickness, weight transfers, and four-way mobility. He's a relatively sound skater mechanically, too. As he gets stronger, it's not unreasonable to imagine a scenario where this part of his game grows. That's going to be the big thing for Berard - - continuing to develop physically as he joins Providence next season. Well, assuming that that's an option anyway. That's not exactly clear. His defensive habits are relatively sound, but he's not going to come out of many 50-50 puck battles with possession as currently constructed. His skating is mechanically sound, for the most part, but he's not generating a ton of power. His wrist shot is pretty good, but could stand to add a little more zip. This is one of the draft's high-risk, high-reward-type of players. Brett Berard is a long-term projection. but if everything breaks right, he could pay that patience off with competent play in the middle-six of an NHL lineup. "
Nico Daws,"Many people sent me messages over the first half of last season asking what the big deal was with Nico Daws. At the time, I didn't really know either; I thought he looked just fine, but didn't think there was anything about his game that screamed ""shoot him up the draft charts and grab him while you can."" He made some off-ice changes to his conditioning this past year, though, and I think he cleaned up some areas of his game that probably scared scouts off at first. He's got the size. and at least at the OHL level he's clearly got the awareness and the skiII to dominate; he was one of the best goaltenders in the league before the COVID19 shutdown, and that wasn't exactly an accident. He may still get picked a little bit too high because of his size, but as one evaluator I asked explained: ""if your highlights don't look spectacular but you've got spectacular numbers at a good level of competition, I'll put him on my list."" You might want to fall asleep watching Daws some nights, because he never seems to make those 'highlight-reel' saves that put so many other goaltenders on the map. That's because he plays with great positional awareness, though, staying deep because his size enables him to simply get in front of the puck. He doesn't leave shooters with a lot of open area, and he doesn't allow a lot of rebounds to test his speed and recovery; although his athleticism still isn't much to write home about, he plays the kind of game that doesn't render an overly-athletic skill set all that necessary. His tracking sometimes put him a little behind the play earlier in his career, but his size more than made up for it - - and he seems to have cleaned that up this season, leaving him in position more often than not. His posture is excellent, taking up shooting room at the top of the net, and he gets away with less-active hands by absorbing a lot of shots with his chest instead. For Nico Daws, it's hard to really get down to the finer points of what his game needs work with because as his own coach explained earlier this year, he's a prospect who is in the process of making significant dietary and fitness overhauls. I don't love his agility and lateral speed at the moment, but he's naturally a bigger goaltender and those quick, crisp movements simply aren't going to come as easily to him as they do to some of the smaller, more naturally nimble prospects in the draft. It's clear that he's making the effort to improve that, so there's going to be a lot left to look for in his game in the coming seasons: he could stall out as a bigger goaltender who just doesn't have that extra gear, but he could also take his positional soundness and eventually become one of those bigger goaltenders who's nearly impossible to beat. As goaltenders like Robin Lehner prove, you don't need to be able to move like Sergei Bobrovsky to be a star. I've tagged Daws' reaction timing on a handful of plays as something that disappointed me, but it's tough to tell how much of that was conditioning; I saw less of it the later we got into last season, so I think that's an area that he's starting to iron out all on his own. "
Daemon Hunt,"There was a decent amount of hype for Moose Jaw Warriors defenceman Daemon Hunt coming into the year. Putting up 20 points as a 16-year-old WHL rookie will do that. Then the 2019-20 season happened, and what a cruel season it was for everyone in Moose Jaw. Perhaps no one suffered it more than Hunt, who lost most of his year to a freak injury - - a skate laceration to his arm - - suffered in December, one which cost him three months of the season. The only loss more substantial than the time playing time and developmental opportunities might've been the one that injury inflicted on his draft stock. Hunt started the season as a potential first-round pick; he finished it barely clinging to a second or third-round tag in the public sphere. If the list that TSN's Bob McKenzie put together is any indication of how the draft is actually going to play out - - and it usually is just that - - then the NHL holds Hunt in a similar esteem to EliteProspects. That tracks with the conversations we've shared with scouts and executives, too. Why wouldn't they want a player like Hunt near the back-half of the second-round anyway? There's a lot to like. Let's start with Hunt's skating. That's the best part of his game. Hunt explodes through his first two steps, demonstrating real discipline through his stride as he effortlessly generates a ton of power skating the puck up-ice. This makes Hunt a highly effective transporter of the puck at 5-on-5 according to our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown's collection of data from the CHL and the USNTDP U18 team. Hunt is the most effective player generating successful controlled exits per hour at 5-on-5 in Brown's sample. It's Hunt's four-way mobility that really stands out though. That helps drive much of his value as a puck-carrier, transitioning the play up-ice, but it's an even more effective tool for defending his own blue line. ""Hunt's backwards and lateral quickness facilitate lightning-fast gap closure,"" Brown wrote in his year-end player report. ""He has three-step acceleration to separate from pressure, with smooth pivots that maintain speed, and non-committing footwork (i.e., no crossovers until attacker's route is established) patterns. ""He closes gaps early, using backwards mobility to match the attacker's speed and funnel plays wide. He'll stops plays with precise poke-checks while maintaining active feet, and also has element of physicality. He also has the problem-solving skills to slow odd-man rushes for support."" That physical element really stands out. When Hunt wants to lay the body, it's like Orban's famous bombard, The Bear, slamming through the Theodosian Walls. ""Hunt was out for blood this game, throwing several massive hits,"" Brown wrote in a March game report. That's just par for the course. And because Moose Jaw basically never had the puck; these games were never short on opportunity. While those hits are fun - - so long as you're not on the receiving end of them, anyway - - to watch, they're not the reason Hunt is such an effective defender. It's his high activity rate off of the puck, high-end anticipation, and well-timed movements through the defensive zone that accomplish that. ""He's an instinctive lockdown defender, one who attaches himself to the nearest attacker, with problem-solving skills to limit, if not erase, high-danger chances,"" Brown wrote. ""He's never flat-footed in the defensive zone, always setting backwards momentum in the event of a turnover. He switches well off of his man to support proactively without unnecessary risk, deters shooters with non-committing, fast closeouts. He has a high level of off the puck awareness, communication, and route-finding."" The big question with Hunt is what sort of offence one can expect from him going into next season and beyond. His 15 points (alI assists) through 28 games on the WHL's second-lowest scoring team are nothing to scoff at but they're hardly high-end either. We saw some encouraging stuff from Hunt in our viewings. He maintains an elevated work rate, shows a willingness to join the cycle, and occasionally flashed a relatively potent shot from the point. ""Hunt is constantly moving in the offensive zone without the puck,"" Brown wrote. ""He shifts the geometry of the defence with his activation on the weak side, prods the defence for seams, and once activated, stays down-low to help create. There are some really encouraging signs in the underlying data, too. Hunt may have finished the season with a doughnut in the goals column but there's ample evidence that this is the byproduct of poor finishing luck than any shortcomings on his part. Brown's dataset shows Hunt as a 95th percentile generator of expected goals at 5-on-5 based on the frequency and proximity of his shots. Meanwhile, our partners at InStat Hockey have Hunt down for just under five expected goals on the year. There really is a lot to like about Hunt's game, and we might come to regret not ranking him higher as a result. That's a distinct possibility here, more so than with other players. It'll be interesting to see what happens for Hunt in the coming years. Because if Hunt stays on this track, it's not hard to imagine a scenario where he carves out a fruitful NHL career as a modern defensive defenceman with immense transitional value and utility on the second-unit in both special teams disciplines. "
Michael Benning,"Hockey runs in the family for Sherwood Park Crusaders defender Michael Benning. His uncle, Jim Benning, is the Vancouver Canucks general manager. and himself a veteran of over 600 games. His grandfather, Elmer Benning, worked as a scout for the Montreal Canadiens for about five decades. His brother, Matt Benning, just finished his fourth NHL season with the Edmonton Oilers. If Michael has his way. we'll have to start countenancing the Bennings as one of hockey's dynasties. He's off to a pretty good start. Michael Benning's name has floated in scouting circles for years now. and he's done his part to keep it there for all of the right reasons. Let's start with his last year in the AJHL. Benning finished 12th in league scoring, first for a defenceman, with 75 points (12 goals and 63 assists) in 54 games; the next highest scoring blue- liner was a full 14 points back. For context, Cale Makar himself scored as many points in just as many games in his draft-year. Now, the difference. of course, is that Makar wasn't playing on the 2019-20 Sherwood Park Crusaders. With Arjun Atwal leading the league in scoring and Carter Savoie one spot behind him - - this team had serious firepower. That's not to take away from Benning's role in that finely-tuned machine; it is valuable context though nonetheless. The name of the game for Benning is deception. That's what makes him such a lethal force from the blue line. ""Benning understands how to create space for others through deception and manipulation."" David St-Louis wrote in his year-end player report. ""With head and body fakes alike, Benning hides his passing intentions. He transforms fake-passes and fake-shots into dangle, and fake-shots into passes. He just blends one movement into the next so seamlessly. ""He prepares his moves with weight shifts, reads opposing defenders, and times and spaces them well to take away any chance they might have of recovering."" Then there's his shot. Benning challenges goaltenders with a veritable cannon, one with all the thunderous force of the German 'Paris Gun' of the First World War, and he wields it with much the same mechanical nous as the Kaiser's engineers. ""He shows good mechanics in his slap-shot, firing it hard and with precision,"" St-Louis wrote in a November game report. The way he transfers weight bottom-up through his shot is just so refined for a player at this age. Where Benning sometimes left our staff wanting was in his low work rate off of the puck in the offensive zone. This especially stuck out at the World Junior A Challenge, where J.D. Burke and Mitch Brown had the misfortune of catching Benning play the worst hockey of his Junior A career live and in-person. ""Benning is completely stationary in the offensive zone, particularly at 5-on-5,"" Burke wrote at the time in his notebook. ""His off the puck skating patterns aren't poor, insofar as there isn't any off of the puck skating period. Benning sets up shop at the point, and that's where he stays."" That was a fairly consistent theme at 5-on-5 through the course of his AJHL season too. Burke wasn't alone in noting the bizarrely low activity rate from Benning, a player who can skate relatively well and has displayed no shortage of creativity with the puck on his stick; it was a constant across our staff. One won't find Benning availing himself of many opportunities to activate off of the rush either. He consistently ties himself up in slow-space areas and misses rush opportunities to support the attack. Now, this isn't to say that Benning doesn't contribute to his team's transition-game. He does, but almost exclusively as a breakout pass specialist. Benning can stretch the ice two or three lines at a time, with hard, precise passes off of either foot, and often through layers. ""Benning can see options through forechecking layers, and veils them with deception,"" St-Louis wrote. ""He has a desire to make controlled plays."" On the defensive side of things, Benning has his moments. He's a decent rush defender, one who uses aggression and his explosiveness out of his stance to challenge puck-carriers well in advance of the defensive blue line. He's far less effective in the defensive zone. There's something about in-zone play that leaves Benning static, often on the outside of play and looking in. This passivity on Benning's part proves especially costly in loose puck retrievals. It's simple: If Benning doesn't get there first, he's not coming out with the puck. He's not an excellent skater to begin with, and not decisively sprinting for possession makes matters worse. And at Benning's size - - he's only 5-foot-10 - -  he just doesn't have it in him to win many contested puck battles. Benning, committed to the University of Denver for next season, is going to be a bit of a project. The good news is that their larger than usual ice surface should, in theory, force him to play a more active game off of the puck. Either that, or he'll sink entirely. All of Benning's strengths and limitations considered; we think he has the chance to develop into a No. 4 or 5 offensive defenceman with transitional value, one who might need a little sheltering to succeed at the NHL level. "
Ethan Edwards,"Where Spruce Grove Saints defender Ethan Edwards wasn't even a blip on our radar before the World Junior A Challenge, he became impossible to ignore. On a team with Carter Savoie, and Michael Benning, it was Edwards who distinguished himself as Canada West's best skater. It wasn't particularly close either. Don't let Edwards' modest point totals (33 points in 50 games) in the AJHL fool you. This kid has offensive potential through the roof. You don't get recruited to Michigan as a true Freshman otherwise. It's Edwards skating and high activity rate that informs so much of his value. He's so aggressive carrying the puck up-ice in transition, and he tirelessly works to support the puck in the offensive zone. His sense of timing and spacing are both relatively well-honed. too. The same is true of the way that Edwards defends, whether it's in the neutral zone or defensive zone. He's so aggressive - - to a fault sometimes, really - - closing on puck-carriers, and plays with such decisiveness. Wherein the problem lies presently is that Edwards lacks the corrective mechanisms for when this approaches goes awry. This often leaves him flat-footed and beat to the outside by oncoming rushers. There's a lot of room for Edwards to grow physically, and we anticipate that some of these issues will self-correct once that occurs. He's playing a style that might be a bit beyond his depths as a 5-foot-10,165-pound defender. Still, one has to admire the gusto. Edwards isn't shy about getting in someone's face, and he's shown himself capable of hanging in there along the boards in those nitty, gritty 50-50 puck battles. The real concern that we carry is whether Edwards is going to get the reps necessary to prove his mettle at Michigan. That team is just flat-out stacked for the 2020-21 season, with a lot of reinforcements arriving at the same time. Still, if Edwards fills out physically, there's no reason he can't develop into an impactful transitional defenceman with some secondary offensive value. "
Luke Evangelista,"One of this year's biggest breakout players, Luke Evangelista went from an infrequent fourth-liner on the London Knights to near-point per game scorer. As an OHL rookie, he had just two assists and zero goals. By all accounts, Evangelista is a coach's dream. It's no surprise when taking in his defensive game. He rarely strays from the fundamentals, stopping and starting instead of gliding, taking the extra stride to get under the puck carrier's stick, and staying above the play. He turns would-be shots against into takeaways with decisive challenges. A defensive problem-solver, he diffuses tricky situations like small-area 2-on-1s and hand-offs with a shocking amount of ease. There's little doubt that Evangelista could carve out a bottom-line role with his defensive game, but what about the rest of his game? Offensively, Evangelista's a playmaker with a knack for hitting teammates in space. He weaponizes his anticipation on the forecheck, scanning for a teammate before grabbing possession, then turning the face the slot and passing. Whether he's on backhand or forehand, with three defenders in between or none, he finds ways to get the puck to his teammates. He lacks a bit of pace, slowing down after gaining the zone, entering a glide, then scanning for a passing option. An intelligent off-the-puck attacker, Evangelista's shot pales in comparison. He shoots almost exclusively off of his outside leg. Instead of pulling the trigger inside of his stride, he enters a glide to reorganize his weight, then transfers to the outside leg - too long, and too obvious. To fire off an OHL-calibre wrister. he needs to a significant drawback - again, too obvious. Combined, these prevent him from having any sort of one or two-touch shooting ability. He is, however, a dexterous shooter in-tight, with hand-eye coordination for tips and deflections. Evangelista's skating and puck-handling project as average. His stride lacks consistency and power, while his acceleration patterns are inefficient (he starts with strides instead of a crossover). Occasional toe-drags around sticks occur at a low pace, making them a secondary option, it's clear he understands his limitations. He's probably not a high-upside bet - a bottom-six winger with penalty killing ability and a bit of playmaking zest is the reasonable, but not necessarily likely, outcome. "
Lukas Cormier,"Lukas Cormier's 36 points in the 2018-19 season were the most by a U17 defenceman in the OMJHL since Samuel Girard four years earlier. That productive underage season and the comparison that it evoked had many scouts scribble the Charlotte Islanders high on their lists heading into his draft-eligible season. NHL projections have changed for defencemen like Cormier who stands at 5-foot-9. A few years prior, such a mark. even if it laid next to an impressive stat line, would have acted as an anchor, dragging the prospect far down draft boards. But players like Girard have opened up a path to the world's best hockey league for other diminutive blue-liners. It doesn't mean, however, that Cormier comes out of the same mould as some those other defencemen. His shorter size isn't counterbalanced by higher mobility. He can cover-ice by planting an outside edge under him to spring laterally; his agility allows him to evade defenders and close down on attackers, but his forward stride recovery. the way he kicks his feet and brings them back wide of his center of mass, limits his speed and acceleration. Cormier must improve his skating to reach the NHL. Unlike many other blue-liners, he won't have the fallback of long-range to stop attackers. In Junior, he can be easily overwhelmed defending against multiple threats even with the support of teammates. Attackers know that. Mitch Brown's tracking project reveals that they use his side of the ice disproportionally to break in the defensive zone. Cormier projects more as an offensive defenceman. His shooting ability and his propensity for backdoor plays separate him from his counterparts. In one swift motion, he can catch a cross-ice pass and fire the puck at the top of the cage before the goalie can react. Cormier's shot also serves as a playmaking tool; he aims his cannon at the stick of teammates and also creates rebounds for them to pounce on. The next step in the offensive development of the defenceman is to further improve his passing ability. Opponents respect his shot; he could use the threat of it to open more lanes to teammates in the slot. And in transition, Cormier could better dance from edge to edge to shake the forecheck and pass the puck up-ice more frequently. Becoming a consistent, effective puck-mover is how Cormier will elevate himself past his peers and reach the NHL. "
Yevgeni Oksentyuk,"Flint Firebirds forward Yevgeni Oksentyuk proved his standout 2019U-18 WJC has no fluke, finishing top-20 in OHL scoring as a rookie. In situations where many similarly skilled players enter a glide to beat defenders with their hands, he attacks on angle, then cuts across the front, creating shot, pass, or carry options. He creates advantages with passes and relocating for the give-and-go, and even uses place-and-chase entries if outnumbered. He drives play toward the middle without much risk. He uses 1-on-1 skill only when necessary, keeping the puck out of the defender's reach with pace changes, head fakes, and backhand touch. Ingrained deception gives Oksentyuk's playmaking an easy above-average projection. He masterfully passes out of his shot, threatening the goaltender and sucking in defenders, before finding the open teammate. Even on the backhand, he looks off his target and maintains his stride through the pass. He misses the early pass on occasion by making the extra handle, but improved in the second half. Oksentyuk's shot is quite average from an inability to shoot in stride to struggling to transfer weight for catch-and-release shots, but he has the right mindset. He spaces the offensive zone by using the width of the ice, before collapsing towards the middle. His timing isn't noteworthy, but he has the skill to play in-tight and a capable one-timer from tricky angles. Oksentyuk's skating has been the subject of much debate at EP. A strong lower-body allows him to sink into his cutbacks and turns and explode out. His stride lacks depth, causing him to bend too much up at the hips, while his recoveries are occasionally too wide. He's not a speedster, but he generates an above-average top-end for the OHL. Defensively, Oksentyuk's diligent and aware. The effort comes and goes on the backcheck, but the energy always there as the F1or in the defensive zone. Alert and proactive, he solves defensive problems, eliminates threats, and supports the puck. A well-rounded offensive threat, Oksentyuk's only lacking the explosive skating that NHL teams covet for smaller players. But his high-efficiency creation, all-around offensive intelligence, and energy without the puck should translate without explosive speed. "
Veeti Miettenen,"There are pure snipers, and then there's Kiekko-Espoo U20 winger Veeti Miettinen. This Finnish winger, just five days removed from being eligible for the 2019 NHL Draft, finished the year with 42 goals in 52 games, and led his country's U20 circuit in points with 73. ""One don't score 42 goals in 52 games in the U20 league in your draft-eligible season without a good shot,"" our Finnish scout, Lassi Alanen, remarked in his year-end player report. ""Miettinen has a quality release that helps generate an effective and effortless wrist shot. He's a real power play threat from the half-wall"" He's a pretty decent playmaker too, even if that component of his game isn't anywhere near as lethal as his shooting - - don't confuse Miettinen for a real dual-threat-type of player. ""Miettinen can find players in the seam and in the slot,"" Alanen continued. ""He's a good playmaker from behind the net and from the half wall, as he has the vision to make small, clever passing plays."" Then Miettinen rounds out these skills with a relatively strong skating stride, one which gets him around the ice at a more than sufficient pace. ""He has good edges. and he flashes very good speed,"" Alanen said of his skating. ""He can change his speed and surprise defenders with quick bursts, with good four-step acceleration. This made him a consistent threat on the penalty kilI, where his separating speed was a real threat; he scored many shorthanded goals this season."" The million-dollar question for us is how we should rate Miettinen based on this season considering his relatively advanced age? As Alanen put it, this season would rate well for a 2019 third-rounder, but might not pass muster for someone at the beginning of the second day of the draft. The good news is, we've accounted for that pretty nicely with Miettinen's position, right at beginning of the third-round. There's a nice skill-set at his disposal, and if Miettinen continues to develop physically, then he'll have a real shot of developing into a complementary top-nine winger at the NHL level. "
Ian Moore,"There's so, so much potential packed in St.Mark's defenceman Ian Moore's 6-foot-3 frame, and he's barely scratching the surface of it presently. The term 'raw' gets thrown around a lot these days in prospect circles. To the point where it's almost an eye-roll-inducing term at this point. We're going to make an exception for Moore though. His physical gifts are so obvious for everyone to see. Moore is a gifted skater for a 6-foot-3 defenceman, and a confident puck-carrier who managed a significant portion of the transition burden for his team in our viewings. ""Moore's ability to create speed through the neutral zone is so impressive,"" Daniel Gee, our crossover scout, remarked in Moore's year-end player report. He can generate solid push-through and extension using his long legs -- great use of crossovers to generate power on rushes. Explosive forward stride at times; recoveries end directly under his body, and ninety degree knee bend when he activates. Can play an aggressive gap due to mobility; rush threats mitigated by his pressure."" Then Moore layers on a pretty damn good shot on top of that to round out his offensive toolkit. ""Moore has a hard and accurate slap shot,"" Gee remarked. ""He drops to one knee and generates a ton of flex on his shot. Showed the ability to beat high school goalies clean from the point. Wrist shot also has some velocity to it. He's a dangerous tip threat due to the height and speed of the shot."" It's part of what makes him so confounding. Gee described one of his Moore viewings as having a yo-yo-like quality to it, and that's about as apt a descriptor for his season as you'll find. There was just no telling what one would see from Moore on a shift-to-shift, period-to-period, game-to-game basis. When Burke made the pilgrimage to St. Mark's to see Moore in-person, it was the ultimate Jekyll and Hyde performance. In the first period. Moore seemed unfocused, out of position, and otherwise useless; he was directly accountable for two goals against. Then in the second period, Moore went Beast Mode for two goals and an assist, and made it look easy. This, of course, begs the question whether the prep school environment offered enough of a challenge for Moore - - would he take shifts off in a more competitive setting? There's no easy way to answer this question. It's not like Moore displayed the ability to work within his team's structure at any point in this season. His decision-making was consistently problematic. His defensive habits were, frankly, just awful; whether it was a canyon-sized gap through the neutral zone or a propensity to wander out of coverage in-zone. Assuming there's a USHL season next year: he's going to the best possible environment to develop a more pro-style game. Moore needs the work, and I'm confident that he'll get the right guidance with the Chicago Steel. From there, it's onto Harvard, and that's another great landing spot. If Moore can't develop into a capable NHL defenceman, that's on him. It's going to take a lot of work to coax the best out of Moore but he's so worth the trouble. It's not often that a 6-foot-3 defender that can skate as he does, with that shot, is available at this stage in the draft. "
Dylan Garand,"It's not easy to figure out where Kamloops Blazers netminder Dylan Garand is going to get drafted. Not, of course, for his actual skill set. He's proven to be sharp, fast, and effective, looking controlled and poised out on the ice against his peers. He also managed to shoulder a massive workload before the remainder of the WHL season was cancelled, proving that he was one of the most consistent parts of his Kamloops team en route to their spot as a powerhouse this year. But he's viewed as being a bit undersized, and he plays for a defensive powerhouse - - a twofold knock that leaves a lot of goaltending coaches and scouts impressed by his numbers, but skeptical of how they'll translate when he gets to the higher levels. He has some holes in his game that are tough to evaluate; it's difficult to tell what to attribute to him personally and what simply comes from him not needing to utilize the same skill sets as goaltenders playing behind weaker teams. But from what we've seen so far, it's hard not to like what he has to offer. For a goaltender who's a little on the shorter side, Garand isn't afraid to play a more conservative depth style - - something that gives him an advantage when it comes to the area he needs to cover at any given point in time. He's got smooth movements and a great toolkit, but his strengths come from his rebound control and his lower-body. He moves laterally with both speed and precision, not overshooting his marks often and recovering well when he happens to misread a shot or the play breaks down in front of him. When there's a scramble in front of the net, he's confident enough in himself that he doesn't try to fall on the puck, either; he stays on his knees and gets into position, occasionally trying to poke the puck away or cover it but still avoiding many situations that find him flat on his chest with the puck shoveled in over his head. He recovers well, and he isn't afraid to jump on a puck when he needs to. Nearly everything that Garand does looks easy, but he sometimes almost makes himself look smaller. His stance could use a bit of work, especially for a goaltender who does need to make himself as big as possible. Given how deep he stands in his crease and how much more accurate shooters are going to get once he graduates from juniors. it's going to be tough for him to continue playing a game that focuses so much on sealing the ice down low while leaving the corners unprotected. It's tough to telI how that's going to translate to the AHL (and potentially NHL) level in the future, and it's possible that he's simply utilizing the best way to play against his opponents for the time being. But it's also easy to see how he could end up victim to the Viktor Fasth dilemma once his competition starts to get a bit tougher down the line. "
Justin Barron,"Halifax Mooseheads defenceman Justin Barron spent much of the last campaign on the sideline due to a blood clot. He came back to play inside a weakened Halifax Mooseheads team that sold much of its core talent before the trade deadline. Before he could get the ball rolling, the season was cut short. It wasn't the draft-year scenario the prospect had in mind. Fortunately, the 2019-20 season was Barron's third in the QMJHL and at this point, the defenceman's talents are well-known. Barron produces points in two ways: through the rush and with his shot from the blue line. He loves to transport the puck up-ice, accelerating away from forecheckers while switching from one skating lane to the next. When he breaks in the offensive zone, he looks to cut to the slot or drop a pass to a teammate. And once he moves back to the blue-line, his short-winded slap-shots send the puck flying at knee-level towards the net where it deflects on the stick of teammates. Defensively, Barron should close his gap earlier in the neutral zone to prevent attackers from gaining any speed, but most of the time, they end up crashing against him at the defensive blue- line anyway. Despite some of his strengths, Barron slid down our list due to issues of inconsistency and translatability. While he uses his imposing physique in some games, in other ones, he plays much more passively. He lacks awareness, switch ability, and shows poor stick and angling habits. Attackers often move unchecked behind him and they easily escape his grasp as Barron overreaches with his blade or raises his hands into across check motion instead of denying passing lanes. It's doubtfuI that the grand rushes of the defenceman translate due to his inability to manipulate the feet or attackers and an average at best handling ability. He also didn't show a consistent short-passing game in transition that he could fall back on at higher levels when he finds himself unable to carry the puck up ice himself. Still, Barron's NHL frame and mobility represent a strong base on which an organization can build a sound defensive game. The defenceman could end up serving a team well in a shutdown role in the future. "
Oskar Magnusson,"They don't come much more well-rounded than Malmo Redhawks centre Oskar Magnusson. Just check out the grades; Magnusson is a consistent 5.5-grade across the board. Even the East German judge held with the company line. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes Magnusson tick. He's just so damn competent at every task. He's a smooth-skating centre who put up a ton of points in the J20 SuperElit, so let's start there - - with Magnusson's offensive skill set. He's a pretty good skater, even if an appearance at the NHL's Fastest Skater Competition isn't in his future. ""Magnusson accelerates well with the puck,"" our Sweden-based Dir. of European Scouting, Christoffer Hedlund, wrote in his year-end player report. ""His top speed is alright but probably won't stand out outside of juniors."" Mostly, Magnusson gets by opposing defenders by outsmarting them. He uses tempo changes, rush-lane diversity, dot- line integration, etc. to create space for himself through the neutral zone, and then explodes past them when the moment is right. ""Magnusson uses tempo-swings to beat opponents on the outside before crashing the net with the puck,"" Hedlund remarked. ""He's very active in the way he weaves through the neutral zone and in-transition with the puck on his stick."" He's a relatively skilled handler, too. Magnusson isn't afraid to chaIlenge defenders 1-on-1in big-ice situations, displaying a high level of creativity and confidence in his abilities. Likewise, he's a decent distributor - - Magnusson is much more of a playmaker than a sniper. He's got decent vision, and he plays with a ton of pace as a distributor. It helps that he's a capable one-touch passer to facilitate this playing style. ""Magnusson makes smart and alert passes. He quickly spots passing lanes and takes advantage of them."" Hedlund continued, ""he does a great job of selling the shot before delivering pass, often fooling just about everyone in the arena."" Magnusson's shot might be the weakest of his offensive tools. As Hedlund wrote in his player report. he'd benefit a great deal by cleaning up his release, aIlowing him to get his shot off a bit quicker. Overall. this is just a highly competent player. What Magnusson lacks in a clear separating skill. he more than makes up for with a Jack of all trades approach to the game. If he just gets a little bit better at, well, everything, then there's a real chance that Magnusson could hold down a middle-six support role, albeit on the low-end of that scale. "
Pavel Gogolev,"Guelph Storm winger Pavel Gogolev is this draft's living embodiment of a timeless maxim - - if at first you don't succeed, try and try again. This is Gogolev's third time entering the NHL Entry Draft, and this time he's going to find a partner for the dance. He made sure of that, scoring 45 goals and adding 51 assists, for 96 points in 63 games. That'll do it. It's not like the talent wasn't there. Gogolev always produced at a relatively healthy clip, even going as far back as his first year of eligibility with the Peterborough Petes. It's just that a one-zone player like Gogolev has to reach such astronomical heights in the offensive zone to make up for shortcomings elsewhere; if you're going to be a one-dimensional player, that dimension has to be really damn good. Well, as I take a deep breath, then gesture aggressively towards the stat line portion of his EliteProspects page - - mission accomplished! Now, some of that, of course, is age-related. Even months of separation in age make a big difference at this level, and Gogolev is a 20-year-old who just finished his fourth OHL season. Playing alongside Montreal Canadiens draft pick Cameron Hillis doesn't hurt either. That's not where the story ends though. Gogolev improved his already lethal shot - - we gave him a 6.5-grade as a shooter - - and introduced a secondary, playmaking component to his offensive repertoire. He came into the year an extremely limited shooting threat; he finished the season as a legitimate dual-threat scorer. It's Gogolev's hands that tie this all together. He's such a dextrous puck-carrier. one who plays the puck within a defender's triangle, with his elbow free from his body, and fluid wrist movements throughout. This allows him to complete highly difficult passes of all sorts, whether it's onthe forehand, the backhand, via a slip pass, or a hook pass, or even bank passes. ""I found myself impressed by Gogolev's ability to handle the puck in small-ice scenarios, especially given his relatively advanced size,"" J.D.Burke remarked in a game report. His ability to corral the puck, and swiftly transition into a curl-and-release shot makes him a legitimate two-touch threat every time Gogolev secures the puck in the offensive zone. Where we might quibble with Gogolev's game, even at this stage in his development, is the lack of pace. To quote one Burke game report, ""it's like he's sleep-walking when the puck's on his stick."" It wouldn't hurt Gogolev to work on his skating either. His recovery often lands wide, his posture is a little bit upright, and he lacks separation speed. Still, there's a pretty admirable collection of tools at his disposal, and it's not outside the reaIm of possibiIity that he could tie them all together nicely into a complementary bottom-six, secondary scoring role at the NHL level. "
Gage Goncalves,"There's year-over-year growth. Then there's whatever Everett Silvertips centre Gage Goncalves just pulled off. As a WHL rookie, in his first-year of draft-eligibility, Goncalves scored once and added 14 assists: then he put together a 33-goal, 71-point campaign in a shortened season as a draft-plus-one skater. Something tells me Goncalves isn't going to make it through this year's draft unclaimed. Actually, I'm certain of it; I've spoken to a handful teams who rate him as a third- or fourth-round prospect. So, what happened for Goncalves? By all accounts, he took last year's dismal output as a sign that things needed to change, and then changed his habits. In Layman's: He worked his ass off. It shows. Every part of Goncalves' game was in a much better spot this year than it was in the year prior. The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. Where Goncalves was once a no-threat offensive passenger; he's now a credible dual-threat driver at the WHL level. ""Goncalves' vicious one-timer combines with a cross-slot passing through layers on power play,"" Mitch Brown remarked in his year-end player report. ""He's net and slot-driven with problem-solving skills to adjust to changing situations. He'll show the occasional flash of mid-range shooting bri11iance. And he often finds teammates from behind the goal-line and after escaping puck battles with look-offs and slip passes - - projectable stuff."" While we would've preferred to see Goncalves wield those weapons more consistently, that might not even be where his future lies in the pro ranks anyway. Frankly, at this stage in the draft, it's about getting NHL bodies more than elite top-of-the-lineup talent. To that end, it's worth noting that Goncalves is at a developmental advantage relative to most of his peers in the draft, and the way that we analyze his offensive output should reflect that. Likewise, we should take into account his unsustainable 20 percent shooting clip. He's probably better-equipped to a working person's role at the NHL level - - he's destined for a bottom-six job, if anything at all. We can rely on his skating to help him get there. It's not perfect, but the pathway to improvement is relatively straightforward. ""Goncalves takes slightly above-average stride mechanics and combines them with constant dot line movement, heavy crossover use. and functional use of pace changes,"" Brown wrote. ""His edge-to-edge quickness combined with at-pace handling allows for blended slot cuts."" Those slightly above-average stride mechanics tend to wane late in Goncalves' shifts, but that's not uncommon at this age. It's the sort of thing that can improve with added strength and conditioning. So too will Goncalves' already stable defensive game improve as he builds in those areas. ""He applies constant pressure on puck carrier,"" Brown wrote. ""He uses non-committing, fast closeouts to deter shots. He has switch ability off man for help with proactive decisions and communication. Simply put: He was Everett's go-to for high- leverage defensive situations."" With continued development, and a little refinement around the edges, Goncalves has a chance of bringing that defensive craftsmanship and speed to an NHL lineup. "
Chirstopher Merisier-Ortiz,"Christopher Merisier-Ortiz was the beating heart of the Baie-Comeau Drakkar. He was dialed in every game even when they quickly turned into losing affairs. No other defenceman in the OMJHL this season matched his attention to detail and his intensity. Merisier-Ortiz combines effort with high-level awareness in defensive situations. Knees bent, head always turning, stick deployed in front of him, but not overextended, the defenceman can easily accelerate in any direction to stop entries, passes, and shots. He registers all threats around him, consistently repositions to limit risks, and moves ahead of opposing plays to shut them down. Attackers can rarely hide their intended plays from him. The second the puck moves in control of his team, Merisier-Ortiz sprints up ice with the breakout to create scoring chances off the rush. When he is the one tasked to orchestrate the transition, Merisier-Ortiz's low posture and superior edgework allow him to protect the puck and separate from forecheckers to move it up-ice. Early in the season, his passes were often picked up by opponents, but more head fakes and body feints helped him create a better ratio of controlled zone exits as the campaign progressed. In the offensive end, the defenceman can freeze the odd defender and slip past him with a well-timed pivot to gain the slot, but those creative displays are few and far between. Merisier-Ortiz is content being a blue-line shooter. He catches low-to-high passes, takes two or three quick steps towards the middle of the ice. and whips the puck on the net through traffic. Passed over in last year's draft, the defenceman improved his game in alI facets in 2019-20 to the point where he now possesses many NHL projectable elements. Merisier-Ortiz will never fill highlight reels, but his abilities to keep attacks to the outside and shut it down early and his developing puck-moving talents could provide a lot of value to a team down the road. "
Calle Clang,"When goaltenders Hugo Alnefelt and Erik Portillo were being scouted ahead of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, another Swedish kid kept popping up - - Calle Clang, who was statistically one of the best goaltenders in Sweden's J20 SuperElit league despite being just 16-years-old at the time. Smart and mature, Clang is one of the big names boasted among a particularly strong crop of European draft-eligible goaltenders this fall. He sits below Russian-born Yaroslav Askarov, as do all the others in their class, but would be a confident early-to mid-round pick for a team to bolster their goaltending depth sometime in the near future; while he's likely a few years away from North America, he's set for the pros this season and should be ready for higher levels of competition before we know it. Confident with his tracking and conservative with his depth, Clang looks like the kind of calm, clean goaltender teams salivate over. He plays from his goal line out, rarely getting caught stranded too far from his crease and difficult to beat around the posts or down low. He's got a great read of the game and doesn't seem to struggle with adapting to a stronger pace of play, as evidenced by his clear mastery of the game when facing 20-year-old competition in both his age-16 and age-17 seasons, and he recovers well when he does allow a tough goal. His post play looks sharp and well-practiced, although he doesn't seem overly reliant on hugging the corners any time the play hovers down low, and he has decent skating ability even for a goaltender who seems to prefer a more conservative style. He won't necessarily wow you with an entire highlight reel of flashy saves, but he'll make it near impossible for easy shots to get past him down low and he isn't afraid to challenge in order to take away sightlines. As nimble as he is on his knees, Clang still isn't immune from one of the most common problems seen among Swedish-developed goaltenders his age; even when they've honed in their tracking and developed smart depth, and footspeed, they often have trouble cleaning up the crispness and control in their lateral movement. When he makes a sloppy play, it's often the fault of a slight over slide or overcorrection when pushing across the crease to meet up with a shot borne of quick cross-ice movement or a traffic-laden cycle play. He does a good job of following the puck with his head, but he still sometimes falls victim to the decision to slide when he could push across on his feet - - and he forfeits a degree of control when he does so. This isn't an uncommon problem for Swedish goaltenders, and the success of players like Jacob Markstrom, Anders Nilsson, and obviously Henrik Lundqvist is proof that it's not a problem that's beyond correction. But it is something to watch for - - because when Clang does inevitably make his way to North America, it's an area of his game that could become his achilles heel. "
Ryan Francis,"Few other players started the season as strongly as Ryan Francis. His 27 points in October. shot him up the OMJHL leaderboard and placed his name right next to great forwards like Alexis Lafreniere. In his third OMJHL season. the Cape Breton Eagles centreman seemed to demand the attention of scouts. Unfortunately, his red-hot October pace chilled as winter arrived. He settled around the point-per-game mark for the rest of the 2019-20 campaign, leaving everyone with unanswered questions. Who is the reaI Francis - - is it the one from October or of the rest of the year? The Eagles centreman requires ahigh level of chemistry with line-mates. He is a playmaker first and foremost. He moves the puck around opponents by changing the angle of passes; he spins to use his backhand, hooks the puck through the skates of opponents, and shows poise in possession; he keeps a neutral, deceptive stance, waiting for his wingers to move in open positions behind the back of defenders to hit them for scoring chances. On any given line, Francis connects plays between teammates. But if those can't get open as easily, the centreman struggles to create. He doesn't possess the manipulative abilities of some of the better playmakers in the draft. He thrived with the presence of prolific scorer Yegor Sokolov on his wing early in the year, but when the coaching staff moved the Russian to another line, the impact of the pivot diminished. Francis stilI provided some defensive value through a high, albeit inconsistent motor and he sti11beat the odd defender with stickhandling tricks, but he no longer managed to create the tic-tac-toe plays that drove so much of his success in the early part of the season. As he won't always be paired with the best offensive elements on his team, Francis will need to develop his off-puck offensive play, his elusiveness, and his shot if he wants to remain a scoring pivot at the next levels. "
Theo Rochette,"Theo Rochette battled mononucleosis in October of last year, missing around a month of action. Many players who miss time early in the year have trouble catching up to their counterparts, but on top of that. mononucleosis often has lingering effects. Rochette probably played part of this season with the equivalent of a weighted vest on his back. The virus might have cleared his body, but it usually takes time for it to regain one's full-strength, up to months after the start of the symptoms. Rochette's season has to be viewed with this perspective. The Swiss-Canadian didn't manage to improve much on the production of his U17 season, but simply maintaining a reasonably high scoring rate throughout the last campaign represents an achievement. The centreman is a switchable defensive player. He rarely overcommits and identifies threats around him quite well. He isn't strong in 1-on-1 battles, but he supports breakouts in timely ways and effectively transports the puck up-ice. Once he gets in between blue lines, Rochette's passing ability shines. He consistently finds ways to reach teammates with the puck, bouncing it off the boards, lobbing it ahead into space, backhanding it, or threading it through opposing skates. The centreman continues to act as a distributor in the offensive zone, he scans the slot for teammates and with a couple of quick turns to find a passing lane, he feeds them the puck for one-timers. The issues that plague Rochette's game are the same as many other Junior playmakers. He lacks an ability to get open and shoot under pressure, rarely uses deception and infrequently shows himself capable of manipulating defenders. He doesn't play with a ton of pace, doesn't change his pace. and lacks the quickness and speed to consistently separate from checkers. In other words, Rochette's offensive plays remained limited this past season. He started to create more scoring chances for himself when he joined the Quebec Remparts in the second half of the season, but he still has a long way to go before he can stand as a true dual-threat forward, one able to break defences and dictate the flow of the game. That said, it's probable that the new season brings renewed energy to the forward. We might see him take large strides in his development. "
Zion Nybeck,"There isn't any denying HV71 winger Zion Nybeck's offensive capabilities. His scoring title (66 points in 47 games) last season in the J20 SuperElit makes them pretty damn clear. The question is whether Nybeck is just another elite scorer at the junior level or if there's any translatability to the way he conducts his business. We're not looking for SuperElit skaters: we're looking for NHLers. To wit, it's hard not to ignore the extent to which Nybeck struggled last season during his 15-game stint with HV71's men's team in the SHL -- one goal in 15 games. On the one hand, it's an awesome sign that he played those games period; on the other hand, it seems a bit instructive of the challenges that lie in front of Nybeck. It's simple: How many 5-foot-8 playmaking wingers with a below average skating stride are there in the NHL? And is Nybeck so far ahead of the pack that he's going to be the exception to that rule? It's pretty hard to say. He's a fairly agile skater, with sound four-way mobility, and decent weigh transfers to maneuver through small-ice scenarios. He's mobile off of the puck, too. But his lack of two-step explosiveness, and a short stride (even relative to his size) conspire against him on the long-track though. He doesn't play with a ton of pace either, and lacks much one-touch proficiency as a distributor. He zigs, and he zags, and he takes his sweet time with the puck. and he can get away with it at this level. It's already proven a challenge at the SHL level though where the pace is much higher. It's Nybeck's playmaking that is going to be his calling card at the next level, if he ever gets there, of course. ""Nybeck makes those minor, clever, nifty short-range passes in the neutral and offensive zones that may not look like game-changers, but they just make life so much easier for everyone around him,"" Christoffer Hedlund wrote in Nybeck's year-end report. ""He's patient with the puck on his stick, willing to out-wait the opposition if that's what's necessary to open a passing lane. He's capable of threading high-quality passes through layers, and displays high-end vision regularly."" He's got a decent wrist shot, too. Nybeck generates a ton of power on his wrist shot, very quickly, and sends it on net with pinpoint precision. His shot placement is pretty advanced, often aiming for rebounds when there isn't an opening for a direct scoring opportunity. You want a boom-or-bust prospect? Nybeck is your guy. He's not going to work in a checking role. So it's the top of an NHL lineup or bust. Does he have enough skill to get there? We'll find out in time. "
Sam Colangelo,"Chicago Steel forward Sam Colangelo, committed to Northeastern University for the 2020-21 season, can do a little bit of everything. Can he play centre? You bet. Can he drive a line? Well, he finished with the highest SEAL (Situational Era Age League) adjusted scoring numbers of any first-time draft-eligible skater on the team, so that's a yes. Can he play a power game? You bet. ""With the puck, Colangelo's skillset allows him to do it all,"" Joey Padmanabhan, our American scout, wrote in his year-end player report. ""He's a smart player and finds his teammates in areas with enough space for them to make plays."" It's Colangelo's vision that serves him best of all his tools in the offensive zone. He's a credible one-touch passer, scanning the offensive zone and maintaining a detailed mental map of the ice that allows for a high-pace offensive attack. Likewise, Colangelo avails himself of that mental map off of the puck, often timing sprints (everything is relative, bear with us here) perfectly into pockets of soft ice untouched. He was also one of the Steel's most relied upon players in high-leverage defensive situations. ""A right-winger witha lot of size and grit. Colangelo boasts a consistent style of play in both ends of the rink,"" Padmanabhan wrote. ""His defensive play is among the strongest on his team and he effectively uses his 6-foot-2, 205-pound frame effectively to rub guys off the puck."" Now, about that skating; a skating stride that we sometimes refer to as ""the skating"" when we broached it in our correspondence over the year with one another. Colangelo would be a first-round prospect if he could move, but he can't. This breakdown of Colangelo's skating, found in a Mitch Brown game report from January, does a great job of itemizing the legion flaws one-by-one. ""The skating, however, remains a problem despite clear improvement since the start of the season. His recoveries are wide on both sides with caving in at the knees, but he's a bit closer to bring his knee under his shoulders on the right side. On the left, he has as significant out-toe with more exaggerated caving at the knees. ""Unable to achieve proper depth through the ankles and with forward-tilted hips, his weight is over his toes, rather than centred over his foot. He lifts his skate without twisting his ankle to complete the extension, then drags his feet back to their starting position. Crossover usage and timing are his best skating attributes, but his crossovers lack extension because of the lack of depth (he doesn't get knee-over-knee). I acknowledge the improvement, but he has a long way to go. I think his off-puck offence is a top-nine-calibre, but without improving his skating significantly, he'll be too slow to make use of it in the NHL."" That sums up the group's thoughts nicely. There is so, so much to like about Colangelo's profile. His scoring compares favourably to so many NHLers who cut their teeth in the USHL at his age. He has a projectable frame. He sees the ice well. He's one tool away from being a coach's dream. Here's the thing, though. If you can't skate, you can't play. Most of the time, anyway. Colangelo has already proven capable of improving as a skater, so we kept him on board, and if he keeps taking big steps in that realm, there isn't any reason he can't be a high-end Swiss Army Knife-like presence in an NHL middle-six. "
Connor McClennon,"It was a tale of two Connor McClennons with the Winnipeg ICE - - one with Peyton Krebs and one without him. Without Krebs, McClennon wasn't much of an impact player. He scored just five goals and 12 assists in 20 games without the Vegas Golden Knights' top prospect. With him? Mcclennon grabbed 16 goals and 16 assists in 22 games before going down with injury. First and foremost, McClennon's a shooter, even if he's not necessarily a high-end finisher. A powerful wrister and one-timer make him a threat from mid-range, while well-timed net-front movement and a hand-eye coordination make him a capable net-front presence. While he's below-average in stature, he'll occasionally bully his way through traffic to the front of the net. A lack of deception on his release, settling for the lower-percentage shot when a higher-percentage option is available, and a tendency to rip pucks off the goaltender's chest hold his finishing back. McClennon's offensive motor translates to off-the-puck play, where his high-pressure game deters shots, prevents entries, and wins retrievals. While capable of high-skill backhand passes, he relies on his shot if there's a defender between him and his target. He lacks the manipulation ability to become a top playmaker, but occasional problem-solving flashes make him at least capable of developing 5.5-grade passing ability. In transition, McClennon gives up on controlled plays too easily, relying on dump-ins when outracing players in a straight line isn't available. When he drives play up the middle, he misses teammates, relies on 1-on-1 skill that he doesn't have, and stops moving his feet, resulting in turnovers galore. The marginal speed advantage that McClennon’s relies on for transition and shooting won't exist in the NHL. A mostly clean stride has a slight flaring of knees and toes at the end of the recovery, causing McClennon to land on his inside edges, reducing glide time. After just one rush, he's unable to push his knees over his toes to achieve proper depth, highlighting strength and conditioning concerns. Similarly, he finds separation with cutbacks early in shifts. but he's unable to achieve the depth to find separation later. Already lacking in strength. the inability to achieve depth makes him even easier to push off balance and eliminate from the play. While those skills give Mcclennon top-nine upside, there's a ton of risk in projection from play-driving and skating limitations. Expect a high-scoring draft-plus-one year, but he has a long road ahead of him."
Eamon Powell,"Don't sleep on United States National Team Development Program U18 defender Eamon Powell. This 18-year-old blue liner, committed to Boston College for the 2020-21 season, can fly out there. He's such a nimble, crafty skater, and that's the basis on which he forms the rest of his game -- skating. ""An aggressive defender despite his 5-foot-11 frame, Powell's agility and great edge work are integral parts of his game,"" Joey Padmanabhan, our American scout, wrote of Powell in his year-end report. This makes Powell such an effective transporter of the puck. He's a confident puck-carrier, happy to lead a rush, or activate as a trailer to support the puck as the second-wave of the attack. ""He didn't create much with the offensive zone established, but in transition, he was dynamic,"" Mitch Brown wrote in a February game report. ""He led the rush, worked the give-and-go, and set-up a couple of chances, including one from behind the net."" As Brown's data shows, Powell is in the top quartile in every transitional category in his data set, save for controlled exit relative to his team percentage. In something of a bizarre twist, we've found ourselves less fond of Powell's work defending the blue line. I'm qualifying that as a bizarre twist, because someone with his skill set should be able to play a tight gap in the neutral zone with relative ease. Instead, Powell plays one of the most accommodating gaps through the neutral zone in the class. Then, on other occasions, Powell overextends himself, playing well outside the dots and suffering that aggression. Another part of Powell's game that needs a little bit of tinkering is the way that he approaches sustained offensive zone possessions. He lacks much of a shot - - Padmanabhan meted out a 4-grade for shooting - - and doesn't maintain a high enough activity rate to get to the parts of the zone where he might credibly threaten to score. ""Powell gets shots through from the point, and while he's not the hardest shooter, he can create chaos with a quick flick of his wrists,"" Padmanabhan wrote. ""Powell does have some tendency to turn away from the puck which can cause him to occasionally miss developments in the play, but considering how talented of a skater he is, this is hardly a reason for concern."" The pathway for improvement -- how a team will develop Powell from being an excellent junior-level defender to a competent NHL one - - is relatively straight forward.Get PowelI to build strength, refine his neutral zone habits, and work on his activity rate off of the puck at both ends of the ice. If there's a team that can make that happen, then PowelI has a chance of developing into a bottom-of-the-lineup, transitional defenceman with some secondary offensive value. "
Eemil Viro,"To describe TPS defender Eemil Viro in a word, I'd land on robust. You're not reading the EliteProspects Draft Guide for one-word scouting reports though. There isn't much flash to Viro's game. He's never going to land on a highlight reel. Never as the conquering hero anyway. There's a decent chance that whichever team drafts Viro can get a physical, sturdy, stay-at-home defender though. That counts for something. ""Viro doesn't hesitate to engage the body in the defensive zone,"" Lassi Alanen, our Finnish scout, wrote in Viro's year-end player report. ""He grew, and added muscle this season and proved he could battle against men."" That's a big feather in Viro's cap, - - the one about battling against men. It's always a great sign when an 18-year-old hangs in there playing in a men's league, and Viro did precisely that for TPS in a third-pair role in the Finnish Liiga. That said, there were moments where Viro made life far more difficult than it had to be. This is especially true on defensive zone puck retrievals. Viro rarely if ever plans an escape before collecting the puck, lacks problem-solving skills, and often eats the puck when opportunities for a breakout pass are right in front of him. Something as simple as playing with less hesitancy could do wonders for Viro. That's going to take some time and careful development, but it's not outside the realm of coachable traits. Besides, he's a good enough skater to get away with it. Alanen found himself fairly impressed with Viro's footwork through the course of the year, as the Finnish rearguard maintained a mostly sound mechanical base. ""Viro has good speed, strong mobility, and he can close gaps quickly. It would help, of course, if Viro could rein in his shoulders a bit; his shoulders sometimes swing wildly from side-to-side, but that's fixable."" He's raw. Viro still needs to learn some of the finer details of playing in-zone defensive hockey. But there's a solid foundation on which to build. He can skate well, plays bigger than his size, and has proven able against men at an age when most are figuring out how to excel against juniors. A team with a strong development staff could probably coax a No. 4 or 5 defensive defenceman with limited transitional value out of Viro if everything breaks right. "
Martin Chromiak,"After playing a limited role with Slovakia's HK Dukla Trencin. Martin Chromiak joined the OHL's Kingston Frontenacs for the second-half of the season. His draft stock received a nice boost as he flanked Shane Wright and eclipsed a point per game. Chromiak's offensive skill is obvious -- he owns an above-average shot and passing skills. With power and crafty placement, his one-timer is a legit weapon from range. A wrist shot with a variety of releases and the confidence to pull the trigger while pressured makes him a counter attack scoring threat. Deft backhand passes through layers and slip passes make him a set-up threat from anywhere. The execution of these skills, however, lags. Poor shot selection prevents Chromiak from making fulI use of his shooting ability, while a failure to identify teammates in-flight makes him a low-pace playmaker. He lacks problem-solving skills to identify superior options to one he's about to make. Without possession, Chromiak's limited. Offensively, he stands around, missing opportunities to back off the defence with a centre-lane drive, get open for a one-timer by flaring wide, or support. Defensively, he watches the puck rip around him as he stands with both hands on his stick. He lacks in strength and body awareness, leading to turnovers and lost battles that he should be winning, and then he doesn't have the energy to try for the second effort. He glides everywhere, reaching for pucks that he could grabby taking an extra stride. Pronounced out-toeing on his right skate reduces his glide time in his stride while choppy, kicking upward crossovers needlessly expend energy. He lacks quickness through his feet, but his low motor and reaction time exacerbate speed concerns. Chromiak is a passenger. His one-timer and crafty passing could make him a decent passenger in the NHL. perhaps on a third line. But don't expect too much. "
Ridly Greig,"Ridly Greig followed up an impressive rookie season with a breakout draft campaign, leading the Wheat Kings in points-per-game while lining up against top competition gamely. Energy and physicality define Greig's game. If there's a scrum, he's involved: if there isn't, he creates one. Although average in stature, few players in the draft bring a more refined physical game and all-out destruction. Outfitted with a seemingly bottomless gas tank, Greig's energy impacts all three zones. He's an intelligent defensive player, ripping away possession on the forecheck and staying above the play on the backcheck. He attacks with pace, barrelling down the outside lane as he prods for openings. High-level use of slip and hook passes give Greig the tool to connect with teammates at top speed and through defenders. Occasional look-offs and fakes buy Greig time to find the trailer to the play. The son of a scout, a Marco Rossi-lite motor, and deft passing ability - what more could one want? A lot, actually. The endless energy leads to dumb penalties, forcing plays that don't exist. and fixating on the chase - rather than positioning - defensively. He's hardly fast enough to consistently turn the corner on defenders in the WHL, let alone the NHL - but it's a go-to play for Greig. An inability to diversify his rushes or adapt to opposition adjustments makes Greig a distinctly average transition threat going forward. While Greig goes hard to the net, there's little timing or awareness considered. He misses opportunities to get open around the hashmarks or faceoff circle. And, beyond a curl-and-drag wrister shot, his shot is average. All of these are forgivable and improvable; he'd still be a valuable bottom-six forward because of his physical game. But to get there, his skating will require significant refinement. He fails to extend his strides, highlighted by near-zero ankle twist (preventing him from pushing off his toes), an inconsistent heel kick, and recovering his stride too far wide. He can't engage his outside edge in his stride, and his depth is severely lacking at the best of times, making him a highly inefficient skater. There's an obvious lack of strength that'll improve with time, but his mechanical flaws are significant hurdles. There's a real chance Greig goes in the first-round, but his lack of upside and probable lengthy development curve keeps him late on the EliteProspects draft board. "
Evan Vierling,"It's amazing what a change of scenery can do for some people. Evan Vierling was doing just fine with the Flint Firebirds but just fine isn't good enough in the context of the NHL Draft. He excelled after a mid-season trade to the Barrie Colts, and that's made all the difference in the world. Want me to a put number to it? Vierling nearly doubled his per game offensive output, going from 0.67 points per game in Flint to 1.21 with Barrie. We've struggled a bit to figure out what it is that makes Vierling tick though. He's got decent visions, and consistently displays the ability to see passing options through layers of defensive coverage. He's not a technically refined passer though and lacks the deceptive and manipulative elements necessary to thread the puck through those needles. All the same, one shouldn't lose the forest for the trees and find themselves too caught up in weighting the mechanical inputs ahead of the statistical outputs. There's no denying Vierling's boxcar stats, and things look great under the hood. Vierling is in the 80th percentile generating expected goals per hour at 5-on-5 in the sample of data that Mitch Brown collected from the CHL and the USNTDP U18 squad last season. It's even better when one doesn't adjust for quality; Vierling generates assists in the 92nd percentile at 5-on-5 on a per hour basis. It's exactly the opposite quandary for Vierling as a shooter. He's a credible shooting threat even at intermediate range, but he hasn't shown a heightened sense of timing or a real penchant for finding soft-ice consistently in the first place. This. of course. isn't to say that there's any cowardice on Vierling's part; he's actually pretty enthusiastic about mucking it up in the most hotly contested parts of the offensive zone. He's even willing to take the puck there himself if he has to. All told, Vierling is a defensively reliable. high-motor, two-way player, and a credible dual-threat scorer in the offensive zone. He needs some refinement, primarily on the offensive side of things where his details are a little bit lacking, but there's a sound foundation in place. It's not hard to imagine a scenario where Vierling figures all of that out, and develops into a bottom-six support piece at the NHL level. "
Ryker Evans,"We'll cut you a little slack if you're not all that familiar with Regina Pats defenceman Ryker Evans. The Pats were one of the WHL's worst teams last season, and there wasn't much for drafted or draft-eligible prospects to make those viewings worth the slog. Clearly, Mitch Brown, our Alberta-based Dir. of North American Scouting, was up to the challenge. He eventually brought Evans to our attention, and rightly so - - as it turns out, there's a lot to like. Let's start with the obvious. Evans finished fourth in scoring (31 points in 63 games) among first-time draft-eligible defenceman, one point short of Everett Silvertips rearguard Ronan Seeley. This section from one of Brown's game reports, filed for a March 6th game against the Saskatoon Blades, sums up Evans' offensive capabilities and the extent to which they were wasted on this team. ""Evans showed some dual-threat skills. He activated off the point, evaded pressure, and found a teammate with ano-look backhand pass under a defender's stick. He ripped the puck around the point with confidence and accuracy, especially on the power play. His shooting stole the show, earning him an assist with a rebound. In particular, his wrist shot with a quick release and serious juice. He showed off some cleverness as a shooter, shooting for deflections and going against the grain. I appreciated how he constantly looked to move toward the middle or activate into space before firing. It's a real shame about the lack of talent on this Pats team - - he doesn't get much help out there."" Where Evans really distinguished himself, though, was in the way that he leverages his high-end skating to great effect in all three zones of the ice. He was a one-man breakout machine for the Pats, probably in no small part because he had to be; if not Evans, then who? That really shows up in Brown's manually tracked data set. Evans is a 93rd percentile generator of controlled exits and controlled exit relative to his team, both per hour measures at 5-on-5. It starts with strong defensive puck retrieval habits. Then his defensive instincts take care of the rest. Evans scans the defensive zone for incoming forecheckers as he closes for possession, and plans his escape well in advance of corralling the puck. He's proven an able problem-solver against numbers, deploying shoulder and eye manipulation to create space with which to carry the puck to safety. He's just as imposing in reverse. With strong skating mechanics, an active stick that guides opposition from the inside out, non-committal footwork, and a good sense of spacing - - Evans is like a Gallic mercenary at The Battle of Lake Trasimene. waiting for the right moment to ambush the puck-carrier and push him into the boards quivering, watery depths. When Evans was stuck defending through in-zone scenarios, his habits were every bit as refined. Evans closes through passes and shots, challenging the shooter as the puck arrives on their stick and mitigating their threat. He's physical when necessary, even if his 5-foot-11frame doesn't necessarily make him a heavyweight. Frankly, Evans reminds us a little of Montreal Canadiens defender Cale Fleury in his draft-year - - they were both strong transitional, defensive defencemen at the same age, with performances in low visibility positions as the result of their grim surroundings. It's easy to imagine a scenario where Evans follows a similar career path, too. He may not have as much pre-draft stock as Fleury did in his draft-year. but it's not difficult to imagine a scenario where Evans develops into a competent No. 4 or 5 defensive with second-unit penalty killing utility at the NHL level. "
Ethan Cardwell,"Barrie Colts forward Ethan Cardwell was a real Jack of all trades-type of forward this year. Whatever the challenge -- Cardwell was up to the task. He really helped solidify their top-six forwards group after joining them in amid-season trade from the Saginaw Spirit. Sometimes that meant taking a beating. but the 5-foot-10. 157-pound Cardwell never shied away from a challenge. Whether it was playing the net front on the power play or plying his trade on the penalty kill; he ably, and dutifully performed his task to the utmost of his ability. It's a shame that. unfortunately, Cardwell's skill level doesn't quite match his work ethic. Mitch Brown, our Dir. of North American Scouting, summed it up well in a February game report, saying ""the effort's always there; the skiII isn't."" Then again, this profile would've appeared much earlier in the guide, so perhaps that goes without saying. Here's where how Cardwell creates value in the offensive zone - - right at the net-front. It doesn't make a ton of sense. given his measurables, but that's just how he operates. Cardwell is a like a dog on a bone, fighting for loose pucks, and often outmuscling the opposition using leverage and well-timed shoulder-nudges to gain the inside track. He times his approach into pockets of soft-ice pretty damn well, too. As this handy shot map, courtesy of our partners at InStat, shows, only three of CardwelI's goaIs came from beyond the hashmarks. That parlays nicely into strong expected goals numbers, according to Brown's manually tracked data. Cardwell is an 82nd percentile generator of expected goals per hour at 5-on-5. That same skill set translates well in the defensive zone. Cardwell is unrelentingly aggressive on the puck-carrier, but in a way that doesn't expose him or his teammates to unnecessary risk. He's physical, hard on pucks, and just a plain old pest sometimes. Likewise, Cardwell tracks exceptionaIly well through the neutraI zone and consistently back-pressures the opposition through their transition plays. The thing with Cardwell is that he's ol' reliable; you just know what you're going to get from him on every shift. He's a high-motor, physical, pesky two-way forward with strong habits at both ends of the ice. Right now, that's about it, though. Which, of course, raises worthwhile questions about his ability to scratch and claw his way to the NHL. If he does so, it's hard to imagine he'll do so in any capacity beyond a bottom-six grinder. "
Dylan Peterson,"United States National Team Development Program U18 winger Dylan Peterson poses a unique challenge as a player evaluation. There were two different Petersons this year. There was the one that left us decidedly unimpressed through most of our USHL and international viewings; then there was the one who looked the part of a legitimate NHL prospect against NCAA competition. If this were a big fish in a small pond scenario, it would be easy enough to brush this aside as Peterson lacking the level of competition necessary to bring out his best. That's only true in the most literal sense though, as most rinks can barely accommodate his 6-foot-4 frame. So, what is Dylan Peterson? In theory, a pretty impactful power forward. He's not a great skater, by any means, but he picks up adequate speed over long enough distances, and he'll surprise you from time to time with the odd flash of high- level puck skiIIs. ""Peterson takes a while to get some speed behind him but is difficult to defend once he gets doing,"" our American scout, Joey Padmanabhan, remarked in his year-end player report. ""His play on the half-wall is mediocre, as are his puck-handling abilities, but once he's established the offensive zone, he recognizes good outlets and finds teammates nicely."" Like many players this size. Peterson is still coming to terms with the immense advantages afforded him by his massive frame. He has a nasty penchant for fly-bys on the forecheck, and we haven't seen him bury the weak side shoulder on a net-drive anywhere near as often as we'd like to. That said, Peterson does a pretty good job of setting up shop at the net front, and he's a lot to handle from that position. He does a good job of getting low in his stance allowing for strength and balance in the face of physical duress, and doesn't mind paying the physical necessary to hang in that spot either. While Peterson lacks the puck skills and the skating stride necessary to become a high-end power forward at the NHL level. there's enough there for a team with a strong developmental staff to think they could coax that out of him with time. It's going to be a long-term project though, and whichever team drafts Peterson is going to need to be cognizant of as much. If they handle this just right, though, perhaps they can make a middle-six power forward-type player of Peterson. He's committed to the University of Boston for next season. "
Albert Lyckasen,"It's a little bit strange, writing Linkoping HC defenceman Albert Lyckasen's profile for the 2020 NHL Draft. Any analysis of Lyckasen should be as a part of our affiliated prospects coverage, and that's it. Someone is sure to right last year's wrong this go around, and Lyckasen will have an NHL team to call his own. He was one of the most exciting defenders in the J20 SuperElit in the 2019-20 season. It all starts with his feet. Lyckasen just flies out there. He was always a fine skater - - even in his first year of eligibility - - but he's taken that part of his game to a whole new level this season. ""Lyckasen visibly improved his north-south skating speed this season,"" our Dir. of European Scouting Christoffer Hedlund wrote in Lyckasen's year-end player report. ""He's gone from an average skater to making that his separating skill in the SuperElit. ""He's much more active and utilizes his skating more this season. He's got great edge work and four-way mobility."" This new found strength as a skater has allowed Lyckasen to play with so much more confidence than he did in a year prior. It's infected every part of his game. He wants the puck on his stick. He wants to lead the puck up-ice. He wants to quarterback the power play. He wants the puck back as soon as his team has lost possession. And he plays like it. ""His confidence-level skyrocketed this season,"" Hedlund wrote. ""He always had so many tools, but he never took advantage of them. This season, he played all-out, and really believed in himself. The contrast is night-and-day."" One of the things that really stands out with Lyckasen is just how much danger he is willing to court to make a play. He's got such a great gravitational pull with the puck, one that creates so much extra space for his teammates every time he's on the ice. This is especially true of the way Lyckasen draws in opponents on the power play, and moving the puck at the11th hour to ensure there as far away from where play is headed as possible. He's got the puck skills and the confidence as a passer to pull it off, so why not, right? Lyckasen also layers on manipulation, deception, and good ol' fashioned chicanery when necessary from the blue line. That's how Lyckasen is going to create the majority of his offensive output. This isn't to say that he lacks a shot. Lyckasen added a bit of pop on his wrister this year, and it's always been relatively precise. It's just that he's not going to be an intermediate or long-range threat without a great deal of traffic. Lyckasen is going to play with HC Vita Hasten in the Allsvenskan for the 2020-21 season, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how he handles the challenge of regular shifts against men in a professional setting. This player has a fair bit of skill, and appears to have projectable elements as a transporter of the puck. He profiles as a modern, transitional defenceman with some secondary offensive value. I've heard those are en vogue these days. "
Blake Biondi,"Blake Biondi, a centre who, by all observations, was too good for to play in Minnesotan high school this year, absolutely trampled over opposing teams for Hermantown High School, producing at a 3.04 points-per-game clip, and playing practically every second shift. Oh, did we mention he won the coveted Minnesota Minute Men Mr. Hockey Award? The award given out to the top senior boys' hockey player in Minnesota? Yeah, that's a pretty big deal in Minnesota. Biondi's presence on the ice was staggering for his opponents. His puck-pursuit angles and the speed that he was able to jump on puck carriers to retrieve pucks is, frankly, elite. His pace and battle level to not only reject exit attempts, but apply himself physically on defenders left no breathing room for his opponents. His bread and butter was his anticipation, swooping into passing lanes, creating turnovers off from an abundance of pressure. By virtue of so much play downlow, Biondi finds most of his offensive success around the crease, digging for rebounds, jamming in pucks, and acting as a screen-tip threat. He has the tendency to throw recently retrieved pucks into the slot, on a hope and a prayer that a teammate will be able to convert. The puck is never on Biondi's stick for too long, jettisoning it without much purpose at times. This extends into his shot selection, where Biondi tends to fire the puck from confusing spots on the ice. Biondi's hands and transitional play can be a bit a limiting factor of his game; he flies at straight at opponents, beating less capable defenders wide, and completely getting shut down by short-gapped defenders who pressure on the blue line. While his motor revs at its maximum capacity and his foot speed can create an infatuating pace, Biondi's rush patterns can veer to the perimeter. His attempts to cut the middle are usually thwarted by poor deke selection, where a lack of deception to manipulate defenders is ever so present. Is this an overestimation of his ability? Is it a by-product of exploiting defenders that he is just a step above skill-wise? It could very well be. Biondi was a divisive prospect during internal debates and rankings; the main area where scouts diverge is the quality of his skating, and whether the inefficiencies are debilitating enough to affect his projectability or correctable over time. Director of Film Scouting, Cam Robinson remarked on a player report from January. ""The wheels are real. He generates a lot of power in a hurry. He keeps the speed up while in possession."" While our Dir. of North American Scouting, Mitch Brown had a less optimistic evaluation of his skating from a game on December 6th, ""Biondi's skating needs a ton of work. He's active and keeps his feet moving, which allows him to create the odd speed advantage. However, his skating has several major issues. First. his stride recovery finishes a bit wide with his toes flaring wide -- limiting the power he can generate with the next extension. Second, as he pushes off his toe, he swings his recovering leg laterally (he kicks his heel up and out) instead of driving it forward. Third, he doesn't hit 90-degrees on his knee bend. Fourth, his crossovers range from average to awful. He tilts his head up, which puts him in a more upright position, to the point where he sits back while crossing over. He sends a ton of the power he generates upward, landing on the heel of his crossing over skate. He looks like he's hopping up a staircase when he crosses over."" There's something to be said when a player has this many mounting inefficiencies in their skating. Are some fixable? Can his skating be reformed mechanically? That will be a major question going forward in his career. With Biondi's path set to remain in Minnesota, committing to the University of Minnesota-Duluth next season, 2020's Mr. Hockey will look to continue his prowess in the Land of 10,000 lakes for the foreseeable future - - - at least until an NHL team comes knocking. "
Carter Savoie,"When we say boom or bust prospect, we make it seem like there is an equal chance that either scenario materializes. That's rarely the case though. Prospects with this makeup end up not reaching the NHL the vast majority of the time. And for Sherwood Park Crusaders winger Carter Savoie, the chance seems even slimmer. There are simply too many weaknesses in his game, too many elements that have to go right for him to carve up a path to the league. Savoie lacks discipline in various facets of the game. He takes bad penalties off retaliatory moves or due to a lack of effort away from the puck. He locks his knees and gIides around, hooking opponents instead of taking a few more steps to close the gap and neutralize attackers. His lack of explosive stance and his suboptimal skating mechanics, his inconsistent knee-bend, his wide stride recovery, and his kicking feet, also have him lose most short and long races to the puck. The issues also continue offensively. Savoie waits for the puck to come to him in the opposing end instead of quickly repositioning to support the play in productive ways. But give the winger the puck and it becomes impossible to ignore his skill. Savoie reads defenders like few other players in the draft. He is acutely aware of opposing sticks and actively baits them. He sets up dangles with weight shifts or short crossover patterns, moves around defenders with timely give-and-gos, and makes them uncomfortable by patiently holding on to the puck. Savoie is deceptive; he looks off his targeted play and keeps the same grip on his stick whether he's passing, dangling, or shooting -- and what a shot he has. The winger scored 53 goals. He might not have the selection of release of some of the better triggermen in the draft, but he has one trusted, extremely effective weapon: his wrister. Savoie fires with power, precision, and with some trickery; he uses screens to his advantage and can change the angle of his shot by dragging the puck towards him. However, Savoie's skiII can also be his downfalI. He has a tendency to try the highlight reel play every time he touches the puck. His grand attempts might have worked in Junior A, but won't as much in the NCAA - - his lack of speed and explosiveness will prevent him from separating from defenders after he pulls the puck through or around them. For Savoie to retain his offensive production, he needs to improve his motor, his skating form and his play away from the puck, defensively, to get more puck touches, and offensively, to finish more off teammate's passes instead of dangles. Whoever drafts Savoie will need a strong development team. Some parts of his game need polishing and others, a complete rework. But as he can compete ability-wise with many first-rounders, a team with a strong appetite for high-skill prospects will likely still snatch him early on the second day of the draft. "
Jack Finley,"Spokane Chiefs centre Jack Finley is an absolute unit. We're just in awe at the size of this lad. That's not why Finley made our final draft ranking though. Checking in with a projectable 6-foot-5, 207-pound frame doesn't hurt. Neither does the fact that he's one of the draft's youngest skaters, 14 days removed from the class of 2021. The reason we rate Finley is because of how he wields that frame to play effective if unspectacular hockey. The defensive zone is where Finley has really distinguished himself with some projectable qualities for the next level. He plays with a high-motor, uses his condor-like wing span to take away large swaths of ice in the defensive zone, displays a high level of switch ability, consistently makes sound off of the puck reads. ""Finley just smothers the opposing centre,"" our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown wrote in Finley's year-end player report. ""He recognizes support opportunities, has the timing and awareness to deter shots and intercept passes, and is decisive without over-committing. ""He wins retrievals on second and third efforts with reach, establishes body positioning early, combines handling skills, and vision with retrievals to escape with pucks. Finley recognizes his limitations, and plays within them. He's tall but not clumsy."" The data that our partners at InStat Hockey collected from the Chiefs' season has Finley rocking a plus-246 shot attempt differential, too. Meanwhile, Pick224.com has the Chiefs commanding a 69-31 advantage in goals for with Finley on the ice. Those defensive results align nicely with much of what we saw from him last season. Unfortunately, Finley won't be much use skating the puck up-ice once he's turned possession for his team - - not at the next level. The neutral zone data that Brown tracked from the CHL and USNTDP U18 squads this year shows Finley rating fairly highly in zone entry and exit success rates. but that's not projectable with his skating stride as currently constructed. Mitch outlined the flaws that limit Finley's explosiveness in great detail in his player report. ""Finley skates with a 110-degree knee bend (rather than the desired 90 degrees), and has a wide stride recovery with flared knees. He deploys high crossover use but they're barely passable with an inability to hit consistent extension (limited knee-over-knee).He really lacks open-ice speed."" So long as someone has done the legwork establishing offensive zone possession, though, Finley can be fairly effective. He's an instinctual passer, capable of finding the trailer or seeing his linemates through levels, and has the technical skill to use reach-altering passes to make sure that the puck meets their stick, no matter the situation. He's a bit of a one-dimensional offensive piece though. Finley lacks a credible threat in his shooting arsenal, and his puck skills don't rate especially well either. He's also got a nasty habit of remaining stationary off of the puck, one that takes him out of a lot of developing plays. There are some worthwhile questions about Finley's draft-year, and they make this a difficult evaluation. How much of his point production can be attributed to playing alongside Minnesota Wild draft pick Adam Beckman? How can one say with any confidence that he'll skate well enough to play NHL hockey? That's why we suspect his path to the NHL likely results in a bottom-six, checking centre role. That's if he makes it at all. "
Billy Constantinou,"Billy Constantinou was well on his way to a spot at the 2019 NHL Draft before amid-season trade from the Niagara lce Dogs to the Kingston Frontenacs completely cratered his scoring and any chance at walking the stage with it. It was just a bad match, at the worst possible time - - Constantinou never seemed to gel in Kingston. The NHL took notice, and Constantinou entered his draft-plus-one year without a team to call his own. So, the Fronts moved Constantinou to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, and everyone is so much better off for it. Constantinou thrived upon joining the Greyhounds, playing a high-leverage role for the team at 5-on-5, switching between Ryan O'Rourke and Robert Calisti in top-four defensive pairings. Skating is the tool that Constantinou is going to use to build himself a long-stay in the NHL - - the usual caveat of whether he makes it at all, etc. He's such an effortless four-way skater. It looks like he's gliding out there. He achieves a deep, 90-degree knee-bend, and really settles low into his stride without collapsing at the hips, allowing for a full range of mobility as he darts up-ice. We slapped a 6-grade on Constantinou's skating, and it's something that really caught our OHL scout Rachel Doerrie's attention in one of her February live viewings. ""His skating at speed and edge work are absolutely breath taking. He's the Soo's best skating defenceman and consistently made plays in transition with his skating."" Our only real critique is that Constantinou sometimes needlessly expends momentum upwards on a straightaway, and could stand to rein his hips in a bit as they tend to flare over prolonged distances. Constantinou's proficiency as a skater translated into a high frequency of zone entries and exits, according to the data that our Dir. of North American Scouting, Mitch Brown. tracked last season. He rates in the 80th percentile or better in four of the six categories in Brown's sample. The Soo used Constantinou as the quarterback of their 1-3-1power play formation over the course of the season. It was just a perfect match. Constantinou is constantly scanning the ice for options, plays with a ton of pace, has a great one-touch pass at his disposaI. and maintains a high activity rate off of the puck. Where one might quibble with Constantinou's lack of a cannon from the point; that's not really impeded his offensive output to this point. He more than makes up for it as a distributor, and I'm not sure that defenceman as triggermen on NHL power plays is long for this world anyway. Now. of course, a defenceman has to defend, and that's been something of a work in progress for Constantinou thus far in his career. There are some poor habits in his game that need ironing out. His tendency to sometimes attack neutral zone puck-carriers in a straight line makes him susceptible to outside rushes. Then, in the defensive zone, Constantinou sometimes stops moving his feet at all, particularly through challenges. He's not especially physical either. His defensive switches need a bit of work, too. He's just not an instinctual defender at this point in his development. Then again, he may be able to get by without becoming a high-end defender at the NHL level. There is. increasingly, room in the NHL for sheltered, transitional specialists on the third pair that can anchor a second-unit power play - - Constantinou might have it in him to be one such player. "
Elliot Desnoyers,"There are some players who put themselves in the thick of it because they feel that they have to; then there are others who relish the fight. Elliot Desnoyers is in the latter camp. If Desnoyers has his way, he'll scratch and claw and bite and kick and scream all the way to the NHL. And if he gets there, he'll earn cult hero status on his team, and loathsome object of hate status basically anywhere else. He's so much better off of the puck than he is on it. Desnoyers is unrelenting in pursuit of the puck, with a motor that never stops running, and he finds a way to win the vast majority of his puck-battles, in spite of his average-at-best 5-foot-11 stature. ""If you want a player who is going to selflessly run head-first through a brick wall if that's what's necessary for his linemates to succeed - - look no further than Desnoyers,"" J.D. Burke wrote in a March game report. ""He's going to run through defenders for offensive zone puck retrievals, and more often than not he's leaving those battles with possession. He's going to relentlessly pester the opposition as they try to carry the puck through the neutral zone. He's going to play an honest brand of hockey in the defensive zone, and never fly a moment sooner than his team has secured the puck."" It's a bit of an odd quandary in the offensive zone. Desnoyers consistently times his movements into pockets of space well, supports the puck, moves his feet, etc. but becomes a fairly limited player once he's achieved possession. His puck-handling tends to be limited by the fact that so much of his movement stems from his forearms, and he sometimes anchors his elbow to his body. The vision that makes him a constant option off of the puck seems to escape him once he's achieved possession. Desnoyers' vision often fails him, and he's not the most dextrous passer. These issues seem to abate, if only slightly, on the rush, where Desnoyers is a much more effective offensive creator. He's a relatively strong skater, and he creates space for himself by attacking on arc, using the dotted-line, and consistently moving east-west in the face of closing opposition defenders. ""Desnoyers looks to attack with numbers,"" our QMJHL scout, David St-Louis, observed in his year-end player report. ""He rushes in arcs and changes speeds to level with teammates and break in the offensive zone with numbers. ""He resists back-pressure well and explodes off the wall to attack inside. He always receives passes in motion to avoid being pinned, and he creates a lot of separation with his first push."" He's not the most skilled player, but Desnoyers works his ass off, and he already has some translatable skills at his disposal. Don't let his lacklustre production (only 35 points in 61games) colour your perception of his competence level in the offensive zone either -- Moncton played Desnoyers on the fourth-line for prolonged stretches, and never really gave him a shot in the top-six over a sustained period. He's going to get a real opportunity next year with the Halifax Mooseheads to prove his mettle. I suspect his offensive output will take a massive leap, too. You're not really swinging for the fences with a Desnoyers draft pick, but it's not hard to imagine a scenario where he develops into a Zach Hyman-like player, with a lot of two-way value and just enough offensive talent to hang in a supporting role relatively high in the lineup. "
Viktor Persson,"Every year, there are draft-eligible players that fly under the radar. This season, Brynas IF defenceman Viktor Persson was one of them. The 6-foot-2, 192-pound defenceman is among the older first-time eligible players, never played for any Swedish national team, has had injury problems, and only played 26 games in J20 SuperElit. That'll do it. Persson did, however, make the most of the games he did play. Hescored18 points (five goals and 13assist), good for the fourth-most productive rate among first-time eligible defenceman in the league. There is so much more to Persson's game offensively than even his point totals indicate. A big part of his success centres on his abilities as a distributor. It starts in the back-end. Persson makes himself available as a passing option and a support outlet for his teammates. With the puck, he plays in a smart and composed way and can quickly start the transition game for his team with precise long-range passes. Persson is a decent skater and can reach alright top speed for a player of his size, but he's most effective transitioning the play up-ice as a passer. Off of the puck, he makes good calls on when to join the rush, and when to play with a more passive posture. Within the offensive zone, Persson maintains a high work rate off of the puck, with active feet and smart skating patterns. This makes him an option for his teammates, even when he's not activating off of the cycle. You're not going to see Persson put together highlight reel calibre passes alI that often. He's more smart, subtle, and efficient than he is flashy. The introduction of a one-touch pass, which would allow Persson to play with a higher pace, would unlock some of his offensive potential. This, of course, ties in with his decidedly average puck skiIls. When shooting from the point, Persson prefers to use his wrist shot, with much more emphasis on on shot-placement than power. Persson has clear strengths and weaknesses while defending, but the foundation to become a solid defensive piece is there. He has the size and reach, but the absence of any real aggression or decisiveness on his part sometimes limits his impact. The worst, most problematic component of Persson's in-zone defending is that he often gets caught puck-watching. This leaves him out of position as plays develop, and it takes away his stick as a passing, and shooting lane disruption. Then on other occasions, Persson will do precisely the opposite, and you'll find him chasing play like a dog after his own tail. In many ways, Persson is more effective at defending on the penalty kill when his role is more apparent and structured. We believe that many of Persson's defensive inconsistencies can be fixed with good guidance and a structured defensive system. Persson might not be the flashiest or most exciting player of this draft crop, but he is smart and effective with the puck and could potentially look to carve out a career as a second or third pairing defenseman. Before that, Persson will play for Kamloops Blazers as he has signed with the WHL-club for the upcoming season. "
Leo Loof,"Farjestad BK detenceman Leo Loof's name might not be one that rings much of a bell, even among real prospect heads. Even though the 6-foot-1,179-pound. defenceman has been a recurring theme on the Swedish national team for the last three years, it rarely comes with a ton of time in the spotlight. With his club, Farjestad BK, Loof has been more prominent. He was among the best players for Farjestad when they reached the J18 Finals in 2019 and was selected as the best defenceman in the league. Last season, L66f played in the J20SuperElit. and he often stood out on a bleak Farjestad roster - - his15 points (two goals and 13 assist) tied for seventh most among U18 defenceman in the league. But it's not Loof's offensive skills that make him an interesting player for the draft. The offensive zone is, in fact. where L66f is most limited. He's a decent if unspectacular passer, but most often prefers to keep it simple. He lacks a threatening point shot, too. Loof is a competent passer but it's a part of his game that is most apparent when he's trying to transition play out of the defensive zone. He skates with strong footwork and decent quickness and plays in an active way to open passing lanes before making stretch passes to start the transition game. Loof is also a technically refined stickhandler, with poise and a sound mechanical base. It's just that his decision-making often takes away from it. There are moments when L66f problem-solves well and continually evades pressure; then there are others where Loot goes headlong into pressure and turns pucks over. At a higher level, Loot needs to make better decisions and utilize his passing abilities more to get the puck out of his own zone. Defensively is where Loof truly shines. He can be a physical force that dominates his opponents by making strong reads and throwing heavy hits. He has notably improved his decision-making off of the puck, and his ability to read the ice in front of him. He protects his blue line in a poised way as he either steps up and plays the body to neutralize the threat in front of him or to force a dump in that his partner can pick up. Further into his own zone, L66f is just as physical. He gets close to the puck and plays the body as soon as there is a chance to do so. He has evolved his thinking and makes better decisions than when the season started rather than to always look to make contact. He is tough as nails along the boards and in front of his own net and can cover a lot of ice with his reach and mobility. Loof might not have the highest offensive upside but to get a strong defensive piece that is able to make plays with the puck late in the draft is nothing to scuff at. He is a typical player that you do not rate because of where he is today, but where he could be if he got it all together. "
Robert Calisti,"Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds defenceman Robert Calisti took just a massive step forward in his development this year, going from seven points in 59 games in his draft-year to 50 in 64 games as a draft-plus-one skater. Not bad, right? Right. Much like his teammate Billy Constantinou (our No. 93-ranked prospect), Calisti's game is built on his effortless skating stride. Our Dir. of North American Scouting, Mitch Brown, offered a highly detailed breakdown of Calisti's skating stride in a February game report, too. ""He was ripping up and down the ice all game long, breaking up plays at one end and leading the rush at the other. His stride is long with under-the-torso recoveries and deep knee bend/shin angle. He consistently extends his crossovers, integrating them into his acceleration pattern and open-ice skating. He kept his feet moving through pressure and maneuvers, allowing him to create advantages across the ice."" He's such an adventurous, confident player in the offensive zone, too. The Soo used Calisti along the half-walI, on his strong side, on the power play, often trusting that he would find a way to get the puck to soft-ice with relative ease. This is, of course, noteworthy because an analytics-savvy organization like the Greyhounds probably wouldn't play Calisti in that role if they weren't confident in his passing ability, even relative to some of the forwards at their disposal. They already had Constantinou at the point. You'll find that the more data-friendly teams, across leagues, have strayed from using two defencemen on the power play. This entry from one of J.D.Burke's March game reports paints a pretty enticing picture of Calisti's capability as a passer. ""He's an adept playmaker that can find teammates through levels and he had one such occasion where he did just that in the first, freezing the opposition with the threat of a shot and then furnishing a pass through two layers of the defence to a teammate at the side of the net-front who fanned on the glorious opportunity."" He's also got a pretty great shot, and he's not shy about getting it off. One might think that a defenceman that goes from two goals to 18 from one season to the next was on the receiving end of a massive percentage bump, but that's just not really the case here. Calisti was a high-volume shooter who earned his goals at every turn. He's a bit volatile defensively though. He's just so aggressive, particularly with the puck on his stick, and sometimes that works against him in the most unfortunate ways. There's a really nice foundational of skills here for an NHL team to work with, and I'II be surprised if one doesn't avail themselves of the opportunity at this year's draft in October. "
Brady Burns,"Undersized forwards are often the playmakers on their line. They dart up ice with the puck, put the brakes to separate from defenders, twist and turn a few times, and then hit their teammates in stride for great scoring chances. However, 5-foot-10 Brady Burns's scoring style is much more unique. Burns, a Saint John Sea Dogs winger, is a hunter. In the offensive zone, he has a keen eye for open spaces. He seems to know where they will appear ahead of time and pounces in them at just the right moment to receive passes and redirect them to the back of the net. Burns doesn't beat goalies from a distance or with shot volume; his release lacks the necessary power. Almost all of his goaIs come from darting in and out of the low-slot and jumping on rebounds. He beats defenders inside the most well-defended area of the ice as he reads the movement of the puck better than them. That's not to say that Burns can't be a creator. His expected primary assists were quite high this season on Mitch Brown's tracking project. With the puck on his stick, the winger is aware of all his options and uses head and body fakes to misdirect defenders into not covering the one he wants to use. Burns is also a fervent user of give-and-gos to move around defenders and create scoring chances. The prospect's numbers were quite impressive this season considering the circumstances. He scored 27 goals on a team that didn't support each other in offensive (and defensive) sequences. With more structure and talented playmakers on his line, Burns will accumulate markers like few others in the QMJHL in the next couple of years. That being said, there are still many issues of translatability in his game There are very few, if any, diminutive net-front scorers in the NHL who are not very physical and better away from the puck than with it. Picking Burns is a bet on pure hockey sense. The team that will select him - - if it happens - - will have to work with him to develop his strength. It will help all of his currently weaker areas: his speed, his acceleration, his shooting power, his ability to protect the puck, and most of all, to win it back. "
Lleyton Moore,"While Oshawa Generals defenceman Lleyton Moore failed to live up to our initial expectations offensively, the rest of his game has progressed enough to land our list. Moore's value starts with his mobility, despite a flawed stride. He doesn't quite get deep enough into his stride and out-toes to finish his recovery, but it doesn't seem to matter. He crushes most opposition players in footraces, and his agility is even better. His cutbacks create legitimate separation, and within two steps, few players are catching him. The quickness makes Moore a strong transition player, highlighted by his escape-ability. His decision-making chain on retrievals - skate, scan, deceive, and escape - is one of the most consistent in the draft. Whether he's looking for the two-line pass or a three-metre touch-pass, his breakout passes keep their target moving. Two improvements are necessary - - improving his route-finding (he tends to skate into pressure without a plan), and reducing the random panic-based dump-outs with easy options. The skating ability drives Moore's continually improving defensive value. Although he's only 5-foot-8, Moore brings physicality and seals off bigger attackers without much issue. He occasionally gets boxed out by attackers, but his speed gives him a corrective tool in these situations. Although he's a touch passive through the neutral zone, he makes consistent, low-risk breakups along the blue line. If he fails to make the stop, he's always within range thanks to his lateral quickness and ability to read the body language of the attacker. Without the puck nearby, Moore's defensive game lacks consistency. Some games, he'll stay locked to his man's hip to eliminated them. Others, he passive and stationary, reacting to the play around him. There's Moore to give offensively here, as shown in flashes when Moore played forward. On the back-end, he must commit to activating into the rush with more consistency, but the tools are: he accelerates out of his passes and generally supports the well when engaged. He's far from a threatening shooter, compounded by a failure to identify space to shrink his distance to the goal. Occasional shot-passes into the slot and point activation to find a teammate nearby highlight his potential as a playmaker. Legitimate glimpses of a top-four defender make Moore a reasonable high-upside swing - but don't count on it. Even if he doesn't figure out the offence, his skating, defence. and transition value could make him an everyday bottom-pairing defender. "
William Dufour,"William Dufour's season was a tale in two parts. He played a depth role in the formation of the Chicoutimi Sagueneens in the first half of the season, but then after a trade to the Drummondville Voltigeurs. his minutes increased and his production followed. Before the campaign was brought to a halt, the winger was scoring at a 40-goal pace and had just put up nights of respectively four and five points against the Acadie Bathurst Titans and the Saint John Sea Dogs. The winger plays a North-South style that fits the Voltigeurs quite well. He pressures opponents. wins the puck. and then skates it up to the offensive zone where he focuses his attention on the goalie. Dufour hit the 100th percentile in shots per 60 minutes on Mitch Brown's tracking project. When the puck touches his stick in the offensive zone, its next stop is the net and quite often the back of it. The winger effectively leverages his 194 lbs in his release motions; he pushes his stick away from his body, uses a contrasting push/pull motion with his hands and leans forward by kicking his inside leg back to activate the flex of the stick. Contrary to many other shooters, Dufour surprises Junior goalies by aiming low, often between the blocker and the pad or the glove and the pad. He also keeps the puck in front of him and shoots with no drag-back in a shoveling motion. Plus, his blade remains closed until the moment of the release, hiding his intended placement. Despite his shooting skill, it's probable that Dufour doesn't score many points if he makes it to the NHL. He needs space to set up his release - - the kind of space he won't find in the NHL. The winger generally has to break stride to aim and doesn't shoot under pressure as well as some of the better scorers in the draft. He also doesn't complete many passes through defensive layers and doesn't manipulate defenders in ways that would translate to NHL points. Still, Dufour's size, projectable NHL average skating, and defensive impact, especially in transition, could make him a useful bottom-six forward for a team in a few years. "
Brandon Coe,"North Bay Battalion forward Brandon Coe entered the OHL three seasons ago as the third-overall pick. While he's made steady improvement each season, his toolkit has yet to pop in the OHL except for flashes. Defence is the strongest element of his game. What he lacks in energy, he makes up with intelligent positioning. He assumes a supporting role without hesitation, identifies helpful defence opportunities, and cuts off the top while constantly scanning the ice. Those habits translate to the offensive zone, where he's always above the play. An advanced physical game allows Coe to win battles, establish body positioning, and escape with possession. There's plenty of skill here, too - waiting to be harnessed. He's 6-foot-3 with an above-average top-end gear (but not a separation gear) and soft hands. When engaged, he dekes through defenders. picks corners from range, and sets up teammates after pulling the defender's stick out of the lane with deception. His hand-eye coordination is among the best in class, getting wood on just about every puck in a meter-and-a-half radius, even with a defender in his face. With those tools, Coe should be a needle-mover every game. Instead, he disappears for lengthy stretches. It's not for a lack of trying. While a gifted passer, he's not a playmaker. He fixates on beating defenders himself rather than passing to create advantages. He's easily driven to the perimeter, and despite his superior size, skating, and hands, doesn't try to drive play back inside. While he dekes defenders with success occasionally, his straight-line, gliding set-ups force him to rely on the accuracy of his hands instead of creating options for a pass, place-and-chase, or cutting across the front of the defender. A December 2001, Coe's closer to a finished product than most of his peers. He likely won't become the player his raw tools suggest, but the chance that he does - however small - that will see him drafted, perhaps even as early as the second round. "
Jan Bednar,"There's something to be said for goaltenders who make fans feel like they're getting the price of admission. HC Energie Karlovy Vary netminder Jan Bednar, above all else, is one of those: he'll post high-flying, free-wheeling saves with windmilled gloves and lunging splits that will wow the crowd and get the job done. His consistency sometimes leaves a bit to be desired, but his athleticism and raw toolkit are among the best in the class. If he's able to rein his game in a bit this upcoming season - - which he's slated to play in North America, with the QMJHL's Acadie-Bathurst Titan, he could be a steal for a team looking for the next Petr Mrazek or Marc-Andre Fleury. Sticks, skates, splits, scorpions... you name it, Bednar has a save in his season reel to show for it. There's no save too out of reach for Bednar to make and no contortion he's not willing to attempt to knock the puck away from the crease - - something that served him well in the Czech Republic, where he played behind a defence that often allowed shooters to walk right into the slot and take their time trying to tease him out of position. Bednar's natural agility is elite, with impressive lateral speed and fast, active hands that he's not afraid to bring into the mix. Sometimes, he appears to work a little harder than he needs to, and his post play still needs some cleaning up, but all of the raw tools put him in a class where it'll just take a little bit more development and he could be a gem. Add in some structure from a defence in front of him, too, and he could really shine; while his game is sometimes chaotic, he never seems frustrated by an even more chaotic play in front of him and he never appears to give up on tricky situations. When I watched the film of fellow Czech netminder Nick Malik and compared it to the film of Bednar early on in the 2019-20 season, I was a little apprehensive about Bednar. He clearly had the physical toolkit and his recovery speed was off the charts, but his overall read of the game seemed to be a little behind that of Malik's - - he seemed to react to the plays more than anticipate them. and although his team's defence didn't always make life easy it was stilI hard to come away from viewings with a ton of confidence in his decision-making. That's not always necessarily a sign that a goaltender isn't going to be able to thrive at the pro level; to this day, one of the biggest knocks against Mrazek is his ability to stay on top of plays and anticipate them confidently, rather than reacting to them. But obviously, a goaltender who relies more on athleticism and reactions than game reads and technique is going to be reliant on feeling physically and mentally one hundred percent every night. It's harder to mask mistakes when a bulk of the saves are made as highlight-reel, split-second snags."
Josh Pillar,"The foundation of Kamloops Blazers forward Josh Pillar's game is skating, starting with his ankle mobility. He pushes his knees over his toes, which allows him to fully sink back into stride (although he tilts his hips forward just a touch too much sometimes), using the length of his skate blade to generate power. He recovers his skates under his body, toes point in the direction of travel with minimal wasted energy. His crossovers are nearly as impressive, consistently completing full extensions with seamless integration into his rushes. Fully loaded cutbacks exited with a crossover give him a separation tool along the boards. While the sturdy foundation makes Pillar quick; he's not a true speedster. However, his pace is a legitimate weapon, maintaining speed through every little maneuver and pass reception. He identifies opportunities to further his speed advantage by baiting the defender with changes of pace and hesitations, then accelerating once they reach. This past season saw continued growth in Pillar's game. highlighted by his defence and willingness to play inside. He's turned into a direct checker who forces poor decisions, supports the play, and occasionally gets involved physically. Added confidence saw Pillar weaponize his skating, particularly along the boards, to escape pressure and drive the slot. The issues with Pillar's game all boil down to one word: execution. A skilled passer, he hits teammates with look-off cross-slot passes while moving and the occasionally backhand dish through layers, but he looks to beat the defender before passing, rather than the other way around. Individualism leads to missed opportunities to create better chances for himself by beating defenders to pockets of space to get open. He occasionally unleashes a threatening shot from range with a deceptive release but struggles to complete one-timers and catch-and-release shots. His rush patterns worsened through the season, becoming increasingly reliant on straight-line attacks instead of the dot line-crossing rushes that allowed him to deceive defenders and gain the inside. Part of this stemmed from his increased confidence with his hands, keeping the puck in front of the body (where he's easier to dispossess), rather than across his hips. While these issues seem small, there's a lot of them. With two of the Blazers' top-four scorers leaving, Pillar's now a top-six lock. Whether he's playing wing alongside Connor Zary or centering the second line with rookie sensation Logan Stankoven, he's set for a big breakout. Pillar's a long-term, hands-on project, but in the mid-rounds, the reward could be worth it: a versatile, pacey third liner. "
Daniel Ljungman,"Not many Swedish players can look back fondly on the way they performed at the 2019 Hlinka-Gretzky Cup. Linkoping HC centre Daniel Ljungman is one of them that can. His four goals were the third-most of any player in the tournament, and Ljungman put together a characteristically strong two-way performance, too. Ljungman's shine wore off as he returned to Sweden. He bounced around Linkoping's J20 SuperElit lineup, but mostly featured on the third or fourth-line and was even moved to the wing in a few games. He still saw consistent ice-time on both special teams' units. Considering his role on Linkoping's team, Ljungman's 23 points (10 goals and 13 assist) was not bad. but it was not close to what some had expected after his strong showing at the Hlinka-Gretzky Cup. When scouting Ljungman, there are two apparent issues to his game that instantly reveal themselves - - his body is far from fully grown and his skating isn't great. A part of Ljungman's skating issues are tied to his underdeveloped body and the fact that he does not have the same power behind his stride as many other players this age. His technique while gathering speed is also lacking as he often has a too wide stance. does not use crossovers enough and can look heavy footed. His two-step quickness is inconsistent but better than the rest of his skating attributes. He compensates for his lack of speed with smart skating patterns though. Due to his lack of core strength, Ljungman's balance and strength on the puck is a noteable weaknesses even at the junior level. This often results in Ljungman spending most of his time playing on the perimeter. Where we start to see Ljungman distinguish himself is with his maturity and his high-end ability to anticipate developing plays. Even if Ljungman is on the losing side of many puck battles; he's still an eager combatant. That's a hallmark of Ljungman's game across all three zones. He's a high-motor player. The most potent of Ljungman's offensive weapons is his wrist shot. For a player on the thin side, Ljungman generates a lot of pop on his wrister, and if he has a little time and space to place it, he's not going to miss. That wrist shot will become even more of a weapon once he adds strength. Any added muscle will help Ljungman hang in there under physical duress in the most sensitive portions of the offensive zone, too. There are few players at Ljungman's age that can boast his defensive credibility. If anything, the real problem is that Ljungman plays it too safe at times. He should be viewed as a long-term project, but Ljungman has the foundation to become a bottom-six, two-way centre in the future. The key here will be patience, both from Ljungman and the team that takes the chance on him. "
Jacob Truscott,"We had some really, really difficult conversations about United States National Team Development Program U18 defenceman Jacob Truscott. It was a brutally difficult evaluation. There was just no telling what version of Truscott would show up in any given viewing. It made the sampling variance from scout to the next especially volatile. Depending on your sample of games, Truscott performed like a second-round prospect or an F-grade. do not draft-prospect. We had to lean a lot on our American scout. Joey Padmanabhan, to try and make sense of it. The one consistent theme across Truscott's season that Padmanabhan identified was plus skating ability. There's the foundation on which an NHL team will attempt to build a stable, robust career. ""While not particularly flashy or skilled offensively, Truscott uses great edge work and mobility to find great passing options, and exits from his own end of the ice,"" Padmanabhan wrote in his year-end player report. It also made Truscott a relatively disruptive force in the neutral zone. At least, that seems to be the case according to the data that Mitch Brown tracked from the USNTDP U18 and CHL seasons. Truscott had enough neutral zone breakups to rate in the 91st percentile according to Brown's sample. By that same token, Truscott allowed a concerning amount of controlled zone entries against - - so, as per usual, it's a bit of a mixed bag. The aristocrats, Jacob Truscott1 The same is true of Truscott in transition - - it's neither a clear cut strength or a weakness. Truscott sometimes makes fantastic decisions in transition, as a puck-carrier and a distributor, and shows some real problem-solving ability; then he'll just look completely lost, as if his brain shorts and sparks start escaping out of his ears against even a one-man forecheck. One can take solace in the fact that Truscott is a technicaIly skiIled passer who can thread the needle in a11 three zones - - even if he doesn't leverage that often enough to be an impact player, proof of concept exists. Whoever drafts Turcott is taking on a long-term project. It's not going to be an easy one either. I'm not sure where one even starts. There are some really nice tools at Truscott's disposal, but there's no telling why he can't put them together for more than one game at a time. Maybe, just maybe, there's a team out there with the developmental nous necessary to coax a top-tour defender out of Truscott. "
Ronan Seeley,"Another year, another intriguing mid-round defensive prospect from the Everett Silvertips - - Ronan Seeley, step on up! This two-way defenceman brings some interesting tools to the table. Let's start with the most unique of them all - - his skating. Seeley is a bit of a living Rorschach test for skating evaluation. He seems so much more explosive than he actually is, in our estimation, and that's in large part due to his unrelenting motor and a high activity rate. It looks like he's constantly in motion, even if there are some inefficiencies that absolutely need addressing. ""Seeley's skating is an interesting evaluation - - he's absolutely quick, especially through three and four steps,"" our Dir. of North American Scouting Mitch Brown wrote in a January game report. ""But the stride's hampered by short extensions and a wide recovery, giving his stride an outrageously high activity level - - makes him look faster than he's actually going. ""His crossovers are the same; he continually lands on his inside edge, but keeps pushing and pushing so it looks like he's moving fast. He's very inefficient, and I tear that his quickness in-tight is more-or-less NHL average without improvement. His skating definitely shows signs of physical weakness, with occasional caving in at the knees and shakiness through pivots and turns."" Ultimately, we landed on a 5-grade for Seeley's skating. It's proven more than sufficient for Seeley to defend exceptionally well through the neutral zone. ""Seeley uses rush-mitigating footwork with stopping power and lateral quickness, and closes gaps quickly, establishing early in the neutral zone, while maintaining backwards momentum,"" Brown wrote in his year-end player report. ""He makes tremendous reads of complex rushes, dealing with hands-off and mini-2-on-1 as welI as anyone in the draft class with a combination of anticipation and confidence."" Likewise, Seeley is an aggressive, confident defender during in-zone possessions. He closes through passes and shots, moves his feet through challenges, and displays a consistent ability to process complex plays as they develop. ""Seeley closes space on potential shooters with purpose, and deters shots,"" Brown wrote. ""His off-puck awareness to tie-up attackers with timing to minimize risk is a big plus. He's physical along the boards to separate opposition forwards from the puck."" There isn't much to Seeley's game in the offensive zone though. He's not an especially dextrous puck-handler, with the garden variety bad habits (an elbow anchored to his body, handling through his forearm, etc.), and not especially creative either. The Silvertips ask a lot of their defencemen in the offensive zone, too, so it's fair to wonder if his point totals - - which are fine - - aren't just the least bit propped up by the team's system. You're probably not banking on Seeley developing into a two-way, top-four defenceman at the NHL level though if you're the team that drops amid-round pick for the privilege this October. The long-term play is one which could see Seeley develop into a capable third-pairing defenceman with some penalty kill utility. "
Jacob Dion,"Drummondville Voltigeurs defenceman Jacob Dion doesn't have the typical profile of an NHL defender. He stands at 5-foot-9, skates at a projectable below average NHL level, and his lack of explosiveness and his short stick complicates his defensive game. He has trouble establishing proper gaps in the neutral-zone, uses too many backward crossovers (which exposes him to dangles), and often stands passively against the offensive cycle of opponents. Dion will have to at least work on his skating form, improving his knee-bend and his recovery, if he wants to make the NHL at some point. That said, even if he has some large roadblocks in his path, the Drummondville Voltigeurs is absolutely worth a pick at the 2020 draft for one reason: his offensive mind. Dion moves the puck up-ice quickly. On regroups, he doesn't make D-to-D passes; he looks ahead and hits teammates in stride or jumps towards the offensive zone himself. He picks up speed with crossovers - - he can actually fly by crossing his feet - - and moves up until he meets pressure. When he senses approaching defenders, Dion either passes the puck hard and precisely to open teammates or fakes opponents into opening up a skating lane to the offensive zone. Once in the opponents' end, Dion starts his work. With and without the puck, he has a knack for selecting the most dangerous offensive play possible. He attacks the slot to improve the location of his writers, runs down the wall to fire passes in between the dots, and slides down cross-ice for backdoor plays. Dion reads the movement of teammates well and positions himself to best complement their plays. Dion was one of the best quarterbacks in the QMJHL last season. Through his forward mentality, his awareness, his use of deception, of space, his manipulative abilities, and his shot, he acted as one of the main engines of Drummondviile's attack. He didn't force plays, didn't get teammates into trouble, but continuously set them up with great offensive chances. He showed the kind of playmaking ability from the backend that could serve an organization looking for more offence. "
Alexei Goryachev,"Loko Yaroslavl defender Alexei Goryachev's offensive potential is limited. He handles the puck with his top-hand glued to his body and dribbles with his bottom-hand, which prevents him from making precise puck movements. His shooting motion also suffers from similar quirks. Goryachev more often breaks his shaft or misses the puck while shooting than scores. But despite some obvious flaws, if you ever stumble upon a recording of a game of Yoko Laroslav (don't tell me you never go deep into the rabbit hole of Russian YouYube), Goryachev will leave you with a lasting impression - - a stunning one. He will impress himself upon your memory in much the same way he impresses forwards upon the boards at the MHL level. The Russian defenceman hits, and he hits hard. Goryachev quite literally kills opposing plays. We can't know if his parents intended this style of game for their son, but they couldn't have given him a more fitting name. Goryachev combines his 8-grade physicality with a very high churning motor. He closes his gap as early as possible on attackers all over the ice, turns his head to locate threats at a break-neck pace in the defensive end, chops the ice to consistently reposition as to best thwart offensive plays, and yanks the puck off of opponents on the boards. Goryachev is an active, aware, and aggressive defender. The MHL tends to favor a dump and chase style of game. It's rare forwards provide close support to defencemen on breakouts, but on top of initiating breakouts by separating opponents from the puck, Goryachev attempted to connect with teammates. He scanned the ice for options and passed or carried the puck up-ice in controlled manners as much as possible. Still, calling Goryachev a puck-mover remains a stretch, but at least, he gives NHL or KHL teams something to work with. An organization with a developmental approach could build on his desire to find teammates to start a rush by helping him work on his passing ability, on his deception and footwork. The defenceman is already an above-average skater at his level. With some work on his stride recovery -- he kicks his feet -- he could reach an NHL average mobility. Goryachev remains a project, but his strong defensive game and his puck-moving foundation could interest teams in the late rounds. It's a safe bet that his bulldozer identity at least catched the eye of a few scouts. "
Yan Kuznetsov,"There's something to be said for a 17-year-old from Northwestern Russia choosing to play his hockey over 6,000kilometres away from home. Now, add on the fact that our subject is attending a Division 1 NCAA College, and plays defence for their hockey team, all while being younger than practically everyone else - - that is the Yan Kuznetsov experience. Kuznetsov's journey has been an immense one, and with a pro-ready body at 6-foot-4 201 pounds, he presents as a player who could be high in the minds of talent evaluators for the 2020 draft. Kuzentsov played limited minutes for the UConn Huskies this season, averaging around 13:41, according to our partners at lnStat Hockey. While he is a very cautious defender - - one who backs off at any semblance of a transitional attack against - - he effectively uses his size advantage to probe for pucks with his long reach and punish opposing players physically. Yan was covered by EP Rinkside from the December's World Junior A tournament in Dawson Creek. These are excerpts from an article published in December. ""With an active stick and the maintenance of a tight gap through the neutral zone, Kuznetsov ably handles oncoming rushers, often dictating their angle of attack and closing against the boards. He's physical but doesn't chase hits."" J.D. Burke wrote. ""In general, though, Kuznetsov is the type of defender that fades into the background. He's at his best when you don't notice him. Kuznetsov uses his long reach to take away wide swaths of the defensive zone effortlessly and eliminate oncoming rushers with ease. ""By that same token, his play with the puck left a lot to be desired. Kuznetsov made sound decisions, but the execution was spotty. I'd developed some concerns about his capability as a puck-handler."" Kuznetsov's defence against the rush and sustained pressure at the college level were similar. He consistently maneuvered bodies and sticks away out of dangerous positions. finished rush threats behind the net and on the side boards, and initiated in pins to halt opposing cycle plays. ""In the first, Kuznetsov made an aggressive play into the neutral zone keeping a short gap with the puck carrier. He used short crossovers while skating backwards to maintain the gap. He checked the puck carrier and the pass went off target; later he sent that same player horizontal after a hit behind the net."" Daniel Gee remarked from a February game log. 'I’m a big kid. I have a big weight, so why not?"" Kuznetsov told Rinkside of his penchant for big hits. ""I can use [my body), so why not?"" "
Ben Meehan,"Undrafted in 2019. but undaunted. defenceman Ben Meehan was a horse for the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders. The UMass-Lowell commit averaged a whopping 20:42 time on ice on a per game basis, according to our partners at lnStat Hockey, and put up a respectable 0.72 points-per-game, placing him eighth among USHL defenders. Although his season was cut short due to injury at the onset of 2020; he possesses too many projectable traits that NHL teams look for in defenders. Vaulting out of High School Hockey at Dexter Academy, he embodied the role of an all-situation defender, whose aggressiveness and proactiveness facilitated the simple but effective mitigation of chances this season. ""Meehan’s ability to locate and lock down secondary threats was excellent; he played pass threats hard, taking opponents sticks away and harassing them physically as they crashed the net. Meehan, while struggling to contain power moves, did an excellent job forcing rush threats to pivot off or separate them completely from the puck using an active stick and gap control that essentially starved them of space,"" Daniel Gee remarked from a game in November. Meehan's decisiveness and timing in his actions, whether it was attacking the neutral-zone puck carrier, activating off the point, or joining in rush-attacks with poise was a hallmark of his game this season. ""He can process the play on a loose puck, assess the risk associated with making a play on it, and close in an instant, often deploying the full weight of his body against the opponent when necessary. That was his approach in the offensive zone, where he must've made three or four physical, quick, decisive pinches to maintain possession for his team."" J.D. Burke observed in a game report from December. His play off the left point is full of deception, regularly freezing forecheckers with body-feints and faked shots and facilitating movement down the right-hand boards. The imprint that Meehan leaves on a game is immense; a culmination of making the smart, purposeful plays at the right times. He is a player who takes it upon himself to defend the dotted lines as if his life depended on it. Does Meehan have things to work on? Don't we all? Meehan won't be winning any fastest skater competitions anytime soon. Our USHL scout, Joey Padmanabhan, had an estimation on his skating from November, ""His skating stride is a bit upright, prohibiting him from getting full extension on his stride. That being said, he moves pretty well laterally... Picks spots opportunistically to join the rush but he struggles to recover back to Dafter he joins the offense as he simply isn't very fast"". Meehan, while possessing active feet, and a great motor, has some mechanical issues with his stride, primarily his wide recoveries, which can deteriorate length on subsequent strides. He also collapses at his hips, affecting his overall posture in his forward stride. Meehan will have to add strength and stay healthy, but he has the markings of a player who could embody a significant next step once again and be a major contributor to UMass-Lowell's defensive corps, sooner rather than later. "
Yaroslav Likhachyov,"There's something to be said for a player like Blainville-Boisbriand Armada forward Yaroslav Likhachyov, a player who's never turned down an opportunity to attempt a highlight reel maneuver. It's a lot of fun to watch. Discretion is the better part of valour? No thanks. That's boring. I'II take Likhachyov's aII-or-nothing approach nine times out of ten, so long as I'm spectator. If I'm a coach or a scout or someone trying to flesh out an NHL roster, the dynamic changes. Now you understand why Likhachyov is in our fourth-round and not our second or third. Naturally, a player who profiles as Likhachyov comes with a pretty crafty set of hands. He's such a creative, gifted puck-handler. There are some AND1 Mixtape worthy maneuvers on his highlight reel. ""Likhachyov is proficient with both sides of his blade,"" our OMJHL scout David St-Louis remarked in his year-end report. ""He can dish, receive, and move around defencemen with backhand and forehand moves. ""He's so creative. Likhachyov consistently finds unique solutions to maintain possession in 1-on-1 attacks. He's deceptive too, blending head and body fakes to open up passing options - - this is especially true of the way he operates on the power play."" We landed on a 7-grade for Likhachyov's puck skiIIs, and even that might be a touch light. He's most proficient creating on the rush. He does such a great job of deploying a gravitational pull to pull defenders into his orbit, often stretching the defensive front on entries until there are openings, at which point he strikes. ""Likhachyov opens passing lanes and skating routes with his feet on entries, and drags the defence laterally to cut the other way or create space for teammates,"" St-Louis wrote. ""He finds pocket of space, times himself to arrive in time as a shot option, and reads the tendencies of his teammates."" There's a lot to like here. If I were in a secure position with an NHL team, I'd be banging the table for Likhachyov late enough in the draft. He's a capable offensive driver, a credible dual-threat scorer, and one with some phenomenal puck skills at that. Here's the thing - - one can learn defence, but they can't learn puck skills like the ones at Likhachyov's disposal. By that same token. I'm pretty sympathetic to why Likhachyov might prove to be a draft pariah. He's all window dressing and no real foundation. There's a really low likelihood he becomes anything at the NHL level. It's a true boom-or-bust situation. "
Artem Shlaine,"If Gordon Ramsay were a scout, he would undoubtedly come to the quick conclusion that Artem Shlaine is a raw hockey player. But unlike the bass served up by a stressed out Sous-Chef, Shlaine shows an offensive flavour, predominantly due to his outstanding puck skills. Shlaine put up numbers good for fourth in scoring in the high school prep hockey for Shattuck St. Mary's. This was done predominantly on the back of his vision, incredibly dexterous hands, and an absurdly accurate wrist shot; Shlaine was a true offensive apex-predator at this level, using his adaptability to be dangerous within 10 feet of the net. Shlaine not only passes through layers, but consistently passes into space, hitting teammates on their tape with accurate and well-timed dishes. His generation of dangerous chances while operating under sustained pressure created high danger chances for his teammates was a substantial pattern this season. ""Shlaine's passing ability shown in this game. In the second, he made a pass from the right hand boards through three layers of sticks to Kunz on the backdoor. He picked up an assist in the second by picking up a pass in the slot and capitalizing on a Culver defender falling; he fed the puck across to Wallace on a short two-on-one. Shlaine's vision is excellent, and his anticipation of developing sequences allows him to complete highly difficult passes."" Daniel Gee observed in a December game. On the rush. Shlaine's ability to employ complex selection of dekes, incorporating body manipulations to trick defenders, and possessing a great maneuverability on his edges. His small-ice game was strong, being able to work through pressure. Shlaine's problem solving proved to be a bit of an issue while carrying the puck transitionally; J.D Burke observed in a game report from February, ""He is not a capable problem-solver and he's susceptible to tunnel vision at times, including one rush in the third period where Shlaine completely missed a trailer after hooking to his weak side because of inside defensive pressure."" While he is an ever present passing threat, his shot is another tool that gives prep school goaltenders grief. Changes in angle, quick release points, and the ability to pick his placement of shots. He shows a willingness to crash and attack rebounds. Shlaine showed wavering ability in the defensive zone. At times, he backchecked hard, supported the puck and his defenders to help win battles downlow. He sometimes goes out of his way to finish checks. Other times, his hockey sense failed him, not possessing the defensive instincts to recognize threats and proper spacing. Shlaine has some stride inefficiencies to work on. He has a very pronounced degradation of mechanics in his stride, rendering him completely ineffective at the end of shifts. His recoveries land wide. and his posture is hunched. He doesn't possess a powerful first two-steps, and shows stunted side-to-side push off. He plays with pace however, keeping active feet in his crossovers. With Shlaine committed to University of Connecticut, that will give him ample time to continue his development to get stronger and developed into his body. He presents a package of offensive upside that could have an NHL club be very satisfied with their pick sometime down the road - - when he's a bit more cooked in the ""oven of time."" "
Alex Laferriere,"There are some really nice qualities to Des Moines Buccaneers winger Alex Laferierre - - not to be confused with Alexis Lafreniere - - and some people in the industry who believe in him a great deal. The Buccaneers didn't really have a lot going for them, and they were one of the lowest scoring teams in the USHL. In that environment, Laferierre found a way to consistently generate offence, and some decent two-way results even though he's not much of a defensive impact player. ""Laferriere really impressed me as a skilled player with great upside,"" our American scout Joey Padmanabhan wrote. ""He's a dangerous player off of the rush who gains the line and creates room for himself with quick horizontal movement to give himself playmaking space. While he's not especially strong, he's unafraid of the physical game and drives hard to the net with the puck."" That's the one thing that really caught our attention with Laferierre - - his gumption. He plays a real power game, even at a modest 6-feet-even and 179 pounds. That's likely not a projectable element though -- think a scoring forward with some grit, not the second coming of Cam Neely. Padmanabhan wrote about this in his year-end report, ""while he's not especially strong, he's unafraid of the physical game and drives hard to the net with the puck."" He'll need to continue to build up his skating stride. Inconsistent use of crossovers in open space, and form that waxes and wanes to match it, limit his acceleration over prolonged distances. Specifically, Laferierre doesn't get fulI leg-over-leg extension on his crossovers, and his posture leaves him tilted at the hips rather than settling nicely into his stride. Another area where Laferierre could stand to improve is in his play during sustained offensive zone possessions. He sometimes struggles to identify pockets of space. times his approaches poorly, and then just goes completely stationary at other times - - this was a massive issue at the World Junior A Challenge, where he eventually played his way out of a prominent role and onto the fourth-line. There's a nice set of skills in Laferierre's game. He's a true dual-threat scorer. But the question is whether he's a talented enough dual-threat scorer to make the show. He's going to Harvard for the 2020-21season - - in theory, anyway - - and that'll be a nice place for his development. He'll need to improve his skating, his off of the puck habits, and just learn to refine his details a bit in the offensive zone. The long-term play is one that probably projects Laferierre to a bottom-six role as a secondary scorer. "
Colby Ambrosio,"Tri-City Storm centre Colby Ambrosio was an offensive driver in the USHL last year. A dynamic offensive force, Ambrosio led the storm in scoring with 50 points (26 goals and 24 assists) in 48 games. That was good enough for 11th in the entire USHL, too. It's suiting. The offensive zone is where Ambrosio really flourishes. He's particularly potent off of the rush, where he combines lateral quickness with deliberate stick-handling maneuvers to open up passing and shooting opportunities. While Ambrosio is doubtless a deft puck-handler. capable of highlight-reel calibre dangles, his sleight frame (5-foot-9,170 pounds) and poor puck protection mechanics often conspire against him and cost him possession. He's not especially strong or well-balanced on his skates either. It's a bad mix. It makes one wonder why Ambrosio doesn't use a more a more speed-oriented approach in the offensive zone, rather than one predicated on widening his stance, slowing down, and courting opponents into his gravitational pull. This strikes us as a pathway to unlocking Ambrosio's offensive potential. Defensively, Ambrosio leaves much to be desired. He's errant positionally and sometimes shows an alarming reluctance to help his defencemen in the corners, instead covering the net-front on the weak side. His anticipatory skills as a centre are also a bit shoddy, as he sometimes tries to play his linemates' positions for them rather than presenting an outlet or moving into open space. On a more positive note, Ambrosio is very good in the face-off circle and was a staple on the Storm's first power play throughout the season. While his skating has been a source of debate amongst our Rinkside scouts, I maintain that Ambrosio gets good extension on his stride and displays above-average acceleration ability. While by the eye test, his ankles rotate too far medially, suggesting an overuse of his inside edges, Ambrosio does not tuck the tongues of skates into his shin pads, which gives the appearance of over-rotated ankles that do not move in line with the knees and shin. All things considered, Ambrosio is a project of a draft pick, but has shown bursts of high-level skill that could suggest a diamond in the rough. "
Jonny Meiers,"Meiers was basically everything for Eagan High School this past season. While co-captaining the team with defender Max Meekin, he played overwhelming minutes 5-on-5, on the power play, and the penalty kill. The Colorado College commit displayed a tenacious, buzz-saw like game that was centred around an unyielding pace of play and battle level. Meiers' neutral zone transition is where his pace unfolds. Power and speed generation through his crossover use, backed off Minnesotan high school defenders with ease, allowing him to create offence off the rush from both a distribution and scoring perspective. Meieres·, showed to have a fairly full tool kit of deception skills while carrying the puck which contributed to his dangerousness. Daniel Gee pointed out some specifics from a game in December, ""He also demonstrated other deception skills in the form of head fakes, eyeline misdirection, and quickly pivoting his ankles and hips to trap defenders into smaller more compressed formations."" His hands, a relative strength of his, showed to be accurate, quick and deliberate in their usage, often allowing Meiers to dance around neutral zone defenders, combining the aforementioned deception skills to do damage. Deke selection showed to be a strong suit, employing inside-out and toe drag moves that sent some defenders flying. Purposeful cutbacks while on the boards under pressure, and excellent edge work, combined with a low centre of gravity made him a problem for Minnesotan high school defenders, who had issues knocking him off the puck. This allowed Meiers to run the cycle, using open ice well and well to draw-in defenders under sustained pressure. Oh, we didn't mention his defensive play, did we? Let's fix that! Meiers' great anticipation, decision making between his defensive zone's dotted lines, and steadfast commitment to quickly apply pressure and take away pass options, helped him have penalty kill sequences like this one that Daniel Gee took in from February, ""As a penalty killer for Eagan, he used his mobility around the ice to effectively jump into coverage of two Lakeville players near the net. His coverage was so good in this case that he rendered them non-options for a pass. On a penalty kilI in the first, he intercepted a pass along the left-hand boards and across crease pass later getting the clear on both Lakeville attempts. He cleared the puck for the third time on this kilI by winning a puck battle down low. poking the puck away from Lakeville's forwards."" The tenaciousness of his forecheck was tremendous in our viewings. Meiers. despite his size, crashed tougher areas of the ice on a shift-to-shift basis laying the body on defenders religiously. Meiers' runs into some issues with the inefficiencies present in his forward stride. He is a wide-track skater, who has fairly wide stride recoveries. This limits his stride length and extensions on continuing strides. There aren't too many smaller, NHL players, who have similar deficiencies. He relies on his crossovers to the ""nth degree"", pushing the pace of his game through his foot speed and limiting the power potential of his forward stride to crossover transitions. With Meiers belonging to the NAHL St. Cloud Norsemen {Tier 11), and a future roster 2021roster spot on Colorado College, could he be a player that people look back on and wonder, ""Where did all this upside come from?"" "
Devon Levi,"Carleton Place Canadians goaltender Devon Levi sits in a unique position among the draft-eligibles right now, because he's been outpacing all of his competition but in a far lower quality league than almost everyone else. Levi has been playing for the CCHL's Carleton Place Canadiens, putting up some of the best numbers in the entire league -- but he's played in extremely limited international competition, and we won't get to see how he truly stacks up against the rest of the draft's top players until he hits the NCAA this upcoming season (presuming play is able to move forward). Granted, Levi put on a spectacular performance for Canada East at the World Junior A Challenge as they took home silver, one that really put him on the map this year. Levi stayed in the CCHL to maintain his collegiate eligibility, so he certainly can't be faulted for the fact that he didn't take a step up in competition this past year. But listed at just 6-feet-even, Levi already has a bit of a hurdle to overcome in the eyes of scouts who are looking for bigger bodies. They saw plenty to be impressed with this year, but the question of how he'd hold up against tougher shooters at his size will linger in their minds. Plenty of agility and great tracking, Levi still needs plenty of refinement in his game but offers a ton of promise combined with highlight reels that show huge strides taken even over the course of his draft-eligible year. Levi moves and reads the game well, offering up plenty of speed when staying on top of the play and trying to make up for his size. He's got great lower-body agility, but doesn't spend much time on his knees before he needs to - - ensuring that those holes up high don't open up too soon and burn him on plays in close. While his movement still lacks top-tier refinement, he does do well with keeping an eye on the puck even after rebounds head back out into play - - and he's cleaned up a lot of his transitions just over the last season alone. He's just as likely to make a diving save as he is to deflect the puck off of his pads. but he recovers well in both situations and doesn't often play himself into a corner with his first and second stops. He handles defensive breakdowns well, too; although the quality of shooters he faces isn't the toughest among his draft class, he thrived when playing at the World Junior A Challenge in December and hinted at what's to come when he does move up to the next level. The biggest area of concern, obviously, is that we haven't seen what Levi can do at the same level of competition that all of his peers have been facing. His numbers are out of this world, but it's unfair to compare what he's been facing in the CCHL - - even with plenty of talented players there - - to what Askarov has been facing in the KHL, Clang in the J 20 SuperElit in Sweden. and others have been facing in similarly high-quality leagues. His depth is a bit of a concern; Levi plays out to challenge at the top of his crease and out into the white paint, which can leave the back door wide open during defensive breakdowns. He worked on cleaning up his movement and controlling his depth more this past year as well, and we saw some of the growing pains that come with that kind of development over the course of the year. But even looking at the jump in his game from 2018-19 to 2019-20 shows that he's a great wild card for a team to take in later rounds. "
Dmitri Ovchinnikov,"A prospect Twitter star, Dmitri Ovchinnikov has been on the receiving end of a disproportionate amount of hype for his skill set. He really stands out in the MHL, not necessarily for his skill, but because he does three things that are hard to find in that league: plays with pace, attacks the inside, and supports the play. Flashy net drives, cuts through traffic, and passing lane creation give Ovchinnikov some offensive flare. He identifies the trailer and teammates through layers, connecting with backhand, spinning, and slip passes. While he's not a manipulator - he fails to commit to his attempted deception, as if he learned the skills without understanding their purpose - his ability to pass, receive pucks, and handle without breaking stride create opportunities. Pace drives Ovchinnikov's value - he's clearly above his peers in the MHL. But he relies on the speed advantage, for the net drives, opening up passing lanes, etc. - - he won't have it elsewhere. His skating is the obvious reason. A wide recovery and out-toeing prevent outside edge use, resulting in more pushes for less speed generation than narrower recovery with toes pointed in the direction of travel. He's unable to achieve depth as early as15 seconds into his shift, suggesting conditioning concerns. His average speed is painfully obvious without the puck, where his seemingly above-average speed for the MHL looks average, at best. Even if Ovchinnikov's skating improves. it won't solve the core issues. He attacks in straight lines, often at a single speed, which both makes him easy to defend and limits the impact of his hands. He can't problem-solve through moves, fixating on the original play without an ability to adjust. A lack of lane deception in the neutral zone leads to an inability to sell fakes in the offensive zone, limiting his creation ability as he moves up the levels. Defence is another positive area for Ovchinnikov, bringing refined decision-making and disciplined compared to his peers. He supports the play, keeps an active stick to deter passes, and brings a consistent effort. His disruption ability, whether it's from all-around effort, intelligent positioning, or both, appears every game. While there's some upside to be had, Ovchinnikov's road to the NHL is lengthy and uncertain. A bottom-six forward with a bit of flash is a possible, but unlikely outcome. "
Kristof Papp,"This year was a tale of two seasons for Kristof Papp, our first Hungarian entrant into the EliteProspects NHL Draft Guide. There was the first-half of his season, when Papp played with the Madison Capitols. That was Papp at his best. He wore the captain's 'C', and scored at just under a point per game clip (19 points in 21games), despite playing on the USHL's worst, lowest scoring team. Then the DesMoines Buccaneers acquired Papp in a mid-season trade, and that player seemed to vanish almost overnight. He continued to score at a decent rate, putting up 16 points in the final 23 games of his season, but something was off. ""Kristof Papp, in all of my Buccaneers viewings, looks like a player who has had the skill, the tenacity, the pace - - alI of it coached right out of his game,"" J.D. Burke wrote in a March game report. Maybe it was just a bad fit? I guess we'll see in time. Because when Papp is clicking, he's playing high-pace hockey, and he has the hands to keep up, too. The Capitols couldn't offer Papp much in the way of offensive support, so he had to create for himself, and that brought out some of the best. most projectable qualities in his game. One needs to be a strong skater to play this style of hockey, and Papp certainly qualifies. He skates with three-point flexion through his stride, starting from the ankle, through his knees. and into his hips. He keeps his weight centred, settles nicely into his stance, and achieves a full 90-degree knee-bend. With the deployment of crossovers through the neutral zone, Papp generates a ton of speed transitioning the puck up-ice. Granted, his puck skills, while relatively strong, sometimes lag behind his feet. He can sometimes prove a bit deferential for our tastes as well, defaulting to give-and-go plays when better options are clearly present. The latter of those items, of course, can be corrected through coaching; the former, less certain. Papp is committed to Michigan State for the 2020-21 season. He's going to get a ton of reps, and probably immediately ascend to a top-six role. It's going to be interesting to see whether the player we saw in Madison or the one in Des Moines was more indicative of his true talent level. We find ourselves leaning with Papp in Madison as being more reflective of his ability. Considering how late Papp is to high-level hockey, this might be a long-term development path, but it's one that could pay off in the form of a bottom-six centre with some value on special teams. "
Raivis Ansons,"Baie-Comeau Drakkar forward Raivis Ansons scored 35 points in his first season on North American Soil after playing his career in Latvia. There's often an adjustment period for European players joining the OMJHL and Anson still finished fourth in scoring on the Drakkar - - a team that struggled to score - - but it's already clear that offence will very likely never be his calling card. He lacks speed, explosiveness, manipulative abilities, a knack for getting open, a dangerous shot, high-end vision... Pretty much all the elements needed for a player to break open a shift and score. But Anson can still bore his share of the offensive load through other talents. He helps teammates on breakouts by occupying pockets of space and presenting his stick as a pass option in a timely manner. He knows where and how to skate to continue supporting them on the rush. In the offensive zone, he pressures opponents, wins the puck, and protects it with his frame, which then allows him to find line-mates with short, effective, and sometimes deceptive passes. In other words, Anson takes it upon himself to do all the little elements that star offensive forwards sometimes prefer not doing. And for that reason, he complements them quite well. Anson shows the same maturity defensively. His stick is always on the ice, cutting the next anticipated passing lane. He adopts risk-mitigating positioning at all times and switches easily from one assignment to the other. All those abilities make him a trusted penalty killer. From his statistical profile alone, Anson doesn't look like a pick in the 2020 draft. But we doubt he goes undrafted. If he can learn to bend his knees a bit more to add more speed and acceleration to his checking game and continues to develop his puck protection abilities. he could become one of those players that NHL coaches absolutely love to have in their lineup - - even if they only use him at the bottom of it. "
Axel Rindell,"This is Jukurit defender Axel Rindell's third try at the NHL Draft, and I suspect this time he'II hear an NHL team call on him. The statistical profile is too good to ignore. Rindell played a depth role in the Finnish men's league, and scored 22 points (seven goals and 15assists) in 47 contests. Even for a 20-year-old, draft-plus-two skater - - that's great. Let me put it this way. If an NHL team had used a third-round pick on Rindell in his first-year of draft-eligibility, they'd be thrilled with his progress. He's developed into a legitimate dual-threat offensive driver from the blue line. ""RindeII is easily an above-average shooter from the point, one that has to be taken seriously as he quarterbacks the power play,"" our Finnish scout Lassi Alanen wrote in his year-end report. ""He has a good one-timer, a deceptive wrist shot, and is good at creating shooting lanes for himself with fakes. ""Though it sometimes backfires, one has to admire Rindell's poise and confidence with the puck when he's under pressure. They're at a high level. He doesn't hesitate to try difficult maneuvers with the puck, whether that's a dangle or pass through traffic."" While RindeII is fairly mobile on the point, with sound lateral agility, it's his skating as a whole that gives us serious concerns about his long-term projection. It's nowhere near the level where it needs to be for the NHL. ""Though he's got solid mobility on the point, he lacks high-end speed or acceleration. This forces his gap control to be a little off at times, which results in him getting absolutely torched off the rush on sudden counter plays. His skating projects as average or below average at this point."" He's fairly raw defensively, too. Someone who skates as Rindell does should probably dial back the aggression a bit. ""He's prone to playing overly aggressive in the neutral zone given his skating. He's often caught puck-watching in the defensive zone, too,"" Alanen wrote. ""He could be sharper in his puck retrievals."" One part of Rindell's game is currently NHL projectable. The rest needs a fair amount of work. The challenge for whichever team drafts Rindell is going to be levelling things out a bit. If they can pull that off, then RindeII could probably play a sheltered bottom-pairing role at the NHL level. The more likely outcome is probably a KHL or SHL career. But that's the thing about the draft - - after a certain point, the odds just aren't in your favour. "
Bear Hughes,"From house league to the WHL to the NHL draft. Timeline: two years. That's right, two seasons ago, Spokane Chiefs forward Bear Hughes was playing rec league hockey. Now, he's a candidate to hear his name called in the latter part of the NHL draft as a re-entry. The most exciting part of Bear's game is that he's, well, a bear on the puck. He put together at least one dominant puck possession sequence per game, outmuscling and out-finessing the opposition. Strength allows him to win battles from disadvantage positions and shrug off checks. Then, he works back into the defender's space, sealing them off the play, before letting his hands do the rest. He keeps the puck across his hips, putting weight over stick and making him tricky to dispossess. With pressure bearing down, he integrates look offs and changes of pace to misdirect defenders. The deft touch translates to Hughes’ playmaking, where he hits teammates with hook and slip passes. Again, he integrates deception into his passing, keeping defenders guessing. Inconsistent accuracy, an ability to spot the trailer, and failure to hit teammates through layers keeps his passing NHL average overall. Hughes is a capable shooter, but lacks the off-puck instincts to translate the skill into gaudy totals. He tends to just stand around the net instead of moving in and out of space, but he's shown improvement there on the powerplay. Defence and skating are two key weaknesses that Hughes that require immediate attention. He puts in the effort defensively, but his brain melts in multivariable situations. He lacks quickness through three steps, driven by a failure to achieve depth in crossovers, preventing him from completing the extension. He over-rotates his upper-body, combined with a wide-ish recovery and failure to sink his hips into his stride. In Hughes' lone season of WHL experience, he flashed NHL ability. His skill level suggests a bottom-six forward, perhaps a capable fourth-liner. Without improvement to his defence and skating, he'll be hard-pressed to make it. Regardless, expect a big offensive outburst next season. "
Luke Reid,"There were some flashes of pure brilliance from Chicago Steel defender Luke Reid last season. The smooth-skating, transitional defenceman seemed to Just weave his way through the opposition at will sometimes. He's so mechanically sound as a skater. It just comes effortlessly to Reid it seems. You're doubtless familiar at this stage in the guide with what we're looking for when it comes to a mechanically good skater. The three-point flexion through Reid's lower-body and a nice posture that allows him to settle into his stance - - that's there. Full leg-over-leg extension on Reid's crossovers, too. His skating habits, however, are a bit of a mixed bag. Reid tends to wander outside when defending through the neutral zone, stops moving his feet through challenges, and seems to lose stride discipline late in shifts. It's strange to see someone struggle so mightily in parts of the game where his skill set should allow him to flourish. Likewise, don't necessarily think of Reid as a puck-mover. He can skate the puck up-ice no problem, but his breakout passes leave a lot to be desired - - the vision, the execution, it's all nowhere near where it needs to be. He's also got a bad habit of over-handling the puck at times. This problem - - the over-handling of the puck - - is something that arises for Reid in the offensive zone. This is, of course, the byproduct of lacking a threatening shot. Reid isn't exactly a technically gifted passer, and the only way he's going to threaten is by skating the puck where it needs to be. This would explain how he produced so little offence on the USHL's highest scoring team. Which, I might add, is extra concerning considering he's only 11days removed from having been eligible for the 2019 draft. This one is a bit of a project, but the potential for a long-term payoff exists with Reid. He's going to get a lot of minutes -- if there are minutes to be had - - at the University of New Hampshire. That's going to help him out a great deal. He needs reps, and he needs a lot of coaching. "
Declan Carlile,"Merrimack defender Declan Carlile finished tied for fourth for scoring among first-year blue liners, all the while playing an impressive average time on ice of 23:25 a game. It wasn't uncommon for Carlile to play as many as 28 minutes for the Warriors some nights. This included 3:38 on the power play and 2:17 while shorthanded, according to the data our partners at lnStat collected. Declan was a minute-muncher as a 19-year-old freshman. Examining Carlile's usage, it wouldn't be a stretch to call the OJHL, USHL alumni a revelation for Merrimack's blue line. He was their best blue liner this year, and that helped our radar catch his signaI for consideration in this October's draft, Carlile is a stalwart rush defender, who meticulously makes smart reads, and executes on great decision-making. His ability to time defensive actions with his stick and his body stood out to our scouting team. Our Director of North American Scouting, Mitchell Brown, observed his defensive play from a game log on February 7th, ""Defence was his best dimension, albeit with one or two mistakes. For the most part, he doesn't leave empty space. He grabs his man and has some ability to switch his assignment decisively. His rush defence stood out, especially laterally, as he closed space on attackers quicker around the defensive blue line. He made some stops high in the neutral zone without committing."" ""He has an active stick and tries to clog lanes by attempting to block shots. Gets to loose pucks quickly."", Russ Cohen remarked from a game in February. We had some differing opinions about the quality of Charlie's play transitionally. Mitchell Brown pointed out in a game log from January, ""He was a mess in transition. He threw away passes with poor awareness and accuracy, and hammered the puck off the glass. The commonality between these was a lack of willingness to use the middle. He didn't even try, despite having teammates available for short-range, low-risk passes in stride"" While J.D. Bruke highlighted a more positive outlook of Carlile's puck-transition from a February game log, ""He's such a smart defender. He keeps his head up, with play in-front of him at all times, and takes excellent care of the puck. Watching him make outlets is akin to watching an NFL quarterback going through their reads, before eventuaIly making the best decision possible."" The commonality in views came when evaluating Carlile's skill, and the relative lack of it. He lacks dynamism in his hands and wont risk committing to anything that could be remotely dangerous He has deceptive moves off the point, implementing some misdirection and pivots to aleve pressure, but that's about it. Carlile will also have to work on his skating, particularly his knee bend and two-step explosiveness. He struggles to get moving off of pivots and from a standstill position, really losing the explosiveness that will be needed off of fast-break transitional plays at higher levels. With Carlile returning to Merrimack College for his Sophomore year next season, he will undoubtedly be in a top defensive role again. With the NHL trending faster, with more rush scoring, he could very welI be in favourable eyes to an NHL franchise who is looking to develop new-age rush defenders. What we do know going forward is that Carlile will play a whole lot next year, maybe even pushing that 23:35 average to new heights. "
Alexander Gordin,"Alexander Gordin had a massive increase in production in his second draft-eligible season playing for SKA-1946.His 68 points,17 more than his next closest teammate, had him finish 6th on the MHL leaderboard and put him back on our radar. Gordin still lumbers on the ice. He doesn't skim and float on the surface as much as he pounds it. He is slow. More often than not, he skates upright, doesn't achieve full extension, lands on his inside edges, and loses momentum due to an overactive upper body. There are worse technical skaters in the draft, but Gordin carries more weight around. He loses most races to loose pucks and can't really catch defenders off-guard in transition even at the Russian Junior level. Gordin's lack of mobility will likely prove to be a fatal flaw as it also limits his pace of play. On the other hand, few other MHLers are smarter than the winger. He works around his skating by using teammates for give-and-gos and by arcing or sliding the puck to them through multiple layers of defenders. Gordin can open up shooting and passing lanes with deception and he uses his backhand and forehand just as effectively to move the puck. He knows how to attract multiple opponents on himself and has a knack for manipulating their feet to escape and attack inside the slot. He might lack the extra-gear to separate from opponents, but he protects possession well; he keeps them on his back, handles with one-hand to use his other arm as a shield, and pivots at the right times to counter pokechecks. Away from the puck. Gordin understands how he can best present himself as an option for teammates. He doesn't sprint into seams, but walks inside them at the right angle ahead of time to immediately offload the puck upon receiving it. Athis best, the winger can fire under pressure, off either leg and from different puck positioning, too. Gordin is a project for a great talent sculptor. There are edges to remove and other parts to reconstruct entirely. But in the end, the carving work might just reveal an effective bottom-six NHLer. "
Michal Gut,"Everett Silvertips centre Michal Gut has an intriguing set of skills that should lead to an offensive breakout next season. Puck-control is Gut's standout trait. In transition, he sets up dekes on a curve rather than straight line, adding in a bit of eye deception and occasional fakes to misdirect the defender. Down-low, he beats defenders with a series of cutbacks and mohawks, with hands and feet each transmitting their own information. He's a forceful handler; when pressured, he fights back with his body, re-establishes positioning, and doesn't hesitate to bring the puck to the net. Despite the lack of goals this season, Gut has scoring upside that should arrive alongside an expanded role. He's a patient, but assertive player around the net who battles for position, then takes the extra second to work the puck through traffic. His timing around the net and wrist shot both need some work, but improved over his WHL rookie season. He loads his wrist shot by sweeping his stick on the ice, rather than applying downward force by sinking his weight into the release within his stride. He flashed an improved release later in the season, masking his release point with minimal drawback. Playmaking and defence aren't strengths, but they aren't weaknesses. Sturdy in puck battles and dependable on the forecheck, Gut at least won't be a liability at the next level. His skating, however, presents a challenge, especially given the consistency of his mechanics. He lacks depth in his stride and crossovers, preventing him from completing extensions. His crossovers work better to the left than right, where he's barely able to get one foot over the other, let alone knee-over-knee. Limited quickness and a total lack of small-area acceleration prevent full weaponization of his puck-handling. All-in-all, Gut's a dependable, creative forward who brings an impressive skill set that should result in WHL success. He's a long shot, but an above-average fourth-liner, who can play a bit higher up if necessary, is a fair projection. "
Benjamin Baumgartner,"Now, for a real departure from the norm, let's broach HC Davos forward Benjamin Baumgartner. He's our only ranked skater from the Swiss NLA men's league. Baumgartner is only our 2nd ranked player from Austria, too. Oh, and if that's not enough, he's a draft-plus-two skater taking his third trip to the draft. Maybe - - just maybe - - this is the year that Baumgartner sticks. Here's the thing. Nothing looks better from a quantitative perspective than putting up points in a men's league. Hell, just playing there is often enough to augur well for a lengthy NHL career. This was Baumgartner's second year in the NLA, and he scored 27 points (seven goals and 20 assists) in 37 games. That, combined with a meek 5-foot-9,165-pound frame makes Baumgartner a real analytics darling. There's a lot of offensive skill packed into Baumgartner's meagre frame. That's going to be his calling card wherever he plays - - the ability to drive offence. The most noteworthy of those skills are in Baumgartner's hands. He's consistently displayed a high-level of skill at every turn. He's a competent handler on either the forehand or the backhand, capable of integrating reach-altering passes in small-ice scenarios, and with loose wrists that allow him to weave in and out of traffic seemingly at his will. J.D. Burke wrote about one such occasion of Baumgartner's skill stealing the show in a February game report. ""Baumgartner showed some subtle puck skills on one play in the first period that really caught my attention, receiving a pass that was well behind him, on his backhand, mid-stride, and then immediately furnishing a stretch pass past the red line to the other end of the ice to send his teammate in on a 2-on-1."" That said, Baumgartner sometimes over-handles the puck, causing him to miss passing opportunities to put his teammates in a position to score. It's not a constant, but something that rears its ugly head in his game from time to time. Overall, Baumgartner is a highly capable distributor. He can find teammates through traffic, displays high-end problem-solving skills, and uses deception and manipulation to create opportunities that might not otherwise exist. The combination of a dextrous set of hands, technically sound passing, and high-end vision make Baumgartner a threat whenever he's on the puck. The lack of a really threatening shot is a touch concerning though. His shot placement is a little on the alI or nothing side - - Baumgartner always tries to pick corners - - and that tends to cost his team possession every now and again. On the one hand, increased accuracy could help iron this out; on the other, being a little more judicial is, theoretically anyway, an easier fix. He's a bit of a boom or bust player. Whichever team drafts Baumgartner isn't going to be cultivating a bottom-six support piece - - they're taking a home run swing. "
Lucas Edmonds,"Vaxjo LakersHC forward Lucas Edmonds is a rare breed. He's a half-Canadian, half-Swedish winger: the son of Randy Edmonds, Team Canada's assistant coach at the World Championships in 2002. Oh, and another thing. This isn't Edmonds' first kick at the can. This is his draft-plus-one season, after he went unclaimed in last year's draft. While Edmonds was born in Canada. he's spent the last few years playing abroad in Sweden. He's also represented Sweden at several different levels, including most recently at the latest edition of the U19 5 Nations tournament in Berlin, Germany last February. We know where his allegiances lie. Perhaps last year was a blip? Edmonds entered the 2018-19 season as an interesting prospect to follow for the 2019 NHL Draft, after a strong draft-minus-one year in Karlskrona in the J20 SuperElit. His regular season left a lot to be desired though. Despite a strong playoffs performance at the J20 level, and a good stint in the Allsvenskan, it wasn't enough to make him stick at the draft. This season was a nice bounce back for Edmonds, who finished with 51points (22 goals and 29 assists) in 44 games at the SuperElit level - - good for the fifth-most points in the league. He looked a lot more dynamic than he did in the year prior, too. Edmonds went to work in the off-season, and that really shows in the way that his skating improved. He wasn't necessarily a poor skater to begin with, but hardly a burner. He was much lighter on his feet this season, settling more nicely into his stride, and playing a quicker, more mobile game as a result. His straightaway speed got the biggest bump. Edmonds generates so much more speed over prolonged distances than he used to, and his two-step explosiveness is a big part of why. Another part of Edmonds' game that took a noteworthy step forward was his play with the puck; he plays with his head up and makes better decisions both when it comes to his passing game and when to stickhandle his way forward. In general, he utilizes his teammates more in transition and with that has become a more diverse player with the puck. In the offensive zone, Edmonds' is more composed and alert with the puck and can hold onto it to open passing lanes.His vision isn't high end, but he is able to make nifty plays to set up goals His most notable offensive weapon is still his goal-scoring attributes. Edmonds has a crash-the-net attitude and brings the puck towards the net as soon as there is a chance to. Further from the goal he looks to reach centre ice, from there he can fire off his lethal wrist shot. Off of the puck, Edmonds is decent at finding open ice and he does not shy away from the dirty areas. He can both poke in a garbage goal from a loose puck but also score of a heavy one-timer, although he could improve his accuracy consistency. Edmonds will not be a high-end defensive player, but he always works hard and puts in the effort while defending. He is effective along the boards, can throw heavy hits to win the puck and decent on the forecheck. Many of his defensive flaws are things that most likely will improve as he ages and mature, like defensive awareness and decision making, as he has the willingness to be a part of his defensive structure. There might not be enough upside for a top-six role in the future, but Edmonds has many of the tools you want to see in a future complementary player or a bottom-six forward that could chip in some extra scoring when needed. "
Johan Strom,"The best draft-eligible goaltender to come out of Sweden for this year is Calle Clang, but I'm convinced some people are sleeping on Johan Strom as a quality late-round pick in his own right. Smart and smooth with his movements, Strom has kept Vasteras IK J20 in more games than they had any business being in. He was a bit more chaotic than you'd expect from a Swedish goaltender, and sometimes got a little aggressive, but our Swedish scouts are enamored with him and he clearly has the ability to juggle multiple things in play that should be interesting to witness as he returns to Vasteras this upcoming year. It's not a guarantee that he's a future NHL-caliber talent, but at the very least he's got a lot of the raw tools to work with. There were a lot of defensive breakdowns in front of Strom this past year, but he handled it well; his read of the game is clearly at a high level, and something that he shouldn't have to do much work on to maintain it as he moves from level to level. Although he sometimes didn't hit his marks as well as he should have, he did a great job of staying on top of the play even when his team left him without a ton of structure to work within. While Strom is also a bit more aggressive than the average Swedish goaltender, he doesn't challenge to a point where he loses control of his crease. His idea of coming out is to meet up with the edge of the blue paint, rarely coming out farther than that: it leaves him able to recover regardless of what happens to the play around him. all while allowing him to take away some of the sightlines from his opponents when they're given a bit more free reign of the offensive zone. It's not often that a goaltender who moves as smoothly and quickly as Strom doesis also one who looks like they need to do some work on their explosive power, but for a prospect who has all the right technique there were times that Strom's strength looked like a red flag. His pushes weren't always enough to get him where he needed to be on time, and although he always seemed to notice and recover quickly it was clear that he could have been sharper and cleaner with a little bit more energy in his lower body. Lots of goaltenders his age move too much, but there was almost a sense that Strom needs to work on being able to consistently move enough. His agility seems good, and obviously there's a balancing act that comes with trying to balance strength and flexibility. But ideally, we'll see him work on that raw strength a bit before he moves on to the next level. "
Hunter McKown,"A bit of a hidden gem in the United States National Team Development Program, Hunter McKown split the 2019-20 season between the U18 and the U17 squads. Exactly why he couldn't find a more permanent role with the U18 team escapes me, especially when one considers some of the forwards that did play consistent minutes on that team. When with the U17 group, McKown was the man, logging big-time minutes, and getting some looks down the middle rather than just on the right wing. With the U18 team, however, he had to settle for deployment scraps, and failed to tie down a consistent shift despite showing some glimpses of playmaking ability and defensive awareness. On both squads, the defensive zone was really where McKown shone brightest. His game lends itself better to centre than it does the wing, simply because he's so damn good at supporting his defencemen in the corners and his wings in transition. Without the puck, he plays sound positional hockey, and picks up the open person well to mitigate scoring opportunities. McKown constantly works to be on the defensive side of the puck to the point where he almost functions as a third defenseman. I've fewer plaudits for McKown's play in the offensive zone, which in and of itself is very deferential. He's a perimeter player offensively and doesn't really gain the middle of the ice off the rush, instead opting to feather passes through to teammates. That said, he makes good passes and is a reliable distributor. While I see McKown more as a centre than a wing, his play in the faceoff circle leaves much to be desired. While clocking in at 6-foot-1,183pounds, he's not exceptionally strong and gets bullied by opponents in the dot. Despite his stature, however, McKown displays good skating mechanics and has decent straightaway speed. He's committed to Colorado College for the 2020-21 season. where he should be given more of a spotlight and ample opportunities to establish himself as a blue-chip prospect. Perhaps McKown can parlay that into the start of a lengthy professional career in a bottom-six support role. "
Alexander Pashin,"Salavat Yulaev Ufa winger Alexander Pashin has an itch he can't scratch. He'll never stop dangling with the puck. He can't stop: he won't stop. He heads straight at defenders with only one idea in mind - - trying to make them look as foolish as possible. Sliding the puck between the stick and skates of opponents gives him a rush that nothing else on the ice seems to match. He craves if. Fortunately, Pashin has a talent for it. His quick reaction time and his slight and precise, rolling-wrist motions keep the puck glued to the heel of his stick and that allows him to move through many MHL opponents. Unfortunately, the success rate of his feint will rapidly go down as he rises in levels, which could leave him adrift. While Pashin moves the puck at lightning speed, the handling part of a dangle is only one of the elements that make it successful. Better defenders will easily contain Pashin if he can't learn to set up his hands by shifting weight, changing speeds, by looking off, and attacking in arcs. Pashin too often faces the opposition alone on the ice. The forward's obsession with dangling reduces his vision, hiding open spaces that he could fill and teammates that he could use. It kills scoring chances before they have a chance to develop. The winger too often takes his first touch on the puck towards traffic to immediately try to beat a defender, when he should turn his back to the opposition and accelerate away to unsettle the defence and pass to the slot. But even if 5-foot- 7 Pashin diversifies his offensive game, it likely won't be enough to earn him an NHL career. While his high motor could give him some defensive value at the professional level, it will no longer hide his average skating stride and his lack of physical ability. Overall, there are large roadblocks in Pashin's path to the NHL. For us, too many to overcome. "
Alex Cotton,"Lethbridge Hurricanes defenceman Alex Cotton, a draft re-entry, is likely to hear his name called this time around, and it's not hard to see why - - this dude can shoot. He has the best one-timer in the WHL, overwhelming goaltenders with power, crafty placement, and a meter-wide wheelhouse. A nearly-as-good wrister with a built-in angle change provides a secondary scoring tool. Throughout the season, Cotton's offensive game around his shot developed. He activated off the point and into the rush more, prodding opposition for seams. He keeps his foot moving through passes to ensure he can jump into the play. He uses the width of the ice to find pockets of space, orienting his body for a one-timer. A deft touch aIlows him to beat defenders in-tight before transitioning into his shot. He's not a playmaker, but uses his shot as a playmaking tool for tips and deflections and shows some ability to run the power play. The next step? Use the threat of his shot to set-up teammates. The issues with Cotton's game are, simply put. everything else. His transition value projects as negative without overhauling his decision-making and skating. He refuses to make the easy play - even if it's the highest-value one. He overestimates his ability by attacking forecheckers and attempting long-range, no-hope breakout passes. A significant lack of depth through his ankles and hips preventing him from loading his stride correctly, while a wide stride recovery with out-toeing inhibits efficiency. He doesn't extend his strides with the ankle twist, kicking his heels upward, and kicking his toes up during his crossovers. His stride improved this season, but there's a notable lack of refinement, strength, and ankle/hip mobility that makes his skating tough to project to the NHL. While Cotton has some value as a rush-stopper in the WHL. it won't translate to the higher levels without improved habits. He steps up without support, rather than keeping backwards momentum to drive the play to the perimeter. His pivots and backwards skating are clunky at best, preventing him from closing space laterally and diffuse small-area 2-on-1s. The slightest of takes cause him to commit his weight and often leave his feet altogether - both while defending the rush and inside the zone. His oft-puck defence is even worse, not even doing the minimum of scanning the ice for threats and staying in the proximity of the opposition player. Despite his point totals, Cotton was carefully sheltered, playing the fifth-most 5-on-5minutes on a team that only used five defencemen regularly. Cotton's shooting ability alone will result in a draft pick, and his development curve has been promising. But without taking extraordinary and unexpected steps in development, he won't get a chance to use his shot in the NHL. "
Antonio Stranges,"Captivation, frustration, and awe: three emotions that London Knights forward Antonio Stranges inspires, sometimes on the same shift. The problem? The second - frustration - is far more common than awe. There's no disputing that Stranges has some flashy skill - - the mohawk skating and 360-degree puck control with an arsenal of 1-on-1moves. Our concerns with Stranges lie in the same skill that make him so intriguing. The mohawk - the heel-to-heel skating stance that has captivated fans and evaluators alike - allows the player to turn and face in the slot in situations where they otherwise wouldn't, among several other benefits (separating from checks, deception, and continuing to accelerate while receiving passes). Instead of capitalizing on this, Stranges uses it in the place of crossovers and turns. While his body is oriented toward the middle, he's fixated on beating defenders. Open teammate with speed moving towards the blue line or deep in the zone? He often doesn't even seem interested, he just handles, handles, and handles. Instead of using the mohawk to work play to the inside, he glues himself to the perimeter. The over-handling prevents Stranges from generating more offence, but the tools - shooting and passing - aren't that great anyway. His shot lacks power and the release lacks quickness, but even more concerning is his complete lack of off-puck movement and timing. That doesn't just extend to his slot-play either - he's an unaware support player at the best of times. He lacks deception - but there are flashes when he uses the mohawk as a tool rather than a crutch. By watching his target and lacking slip and hook passes, he's unable to move the sticks of defenders and lacks the skills to deliver passes through traffic. Then, there's the defensive concerns. Instead of engaging in battles with his body, or even supporting the puck, he skates past the battle while taking a one-handed swing at the puck. Shocker - - it doesn't work with much frequency. He flies the defensive zone in situations where London clearly needs support, and he won't get involved on the backcheck or forecheck with regularity. Seemingly random spurts of high-energy pressure with well-timed across-the-hips stick lifts and occasional defensive problem-solving give reason to believe he knows what to do, he just doesn't. A perimeter player, lacking restraint, poor decision-making, lacking deception. a failure to weaponize his best skills (the mohawk and handling), inconsistent defence, and the list goes on. Really, that lengthy list of concerns just seems insurmountable, especially because Stranges hasn't shown much improvement over the past two seasons. "
Jake Neighbours,"While considered by many to be a first-round pick, Edmonton Oil Kings forward Jake Neighbours won't be found anywhere on the EliteProspects draft board. There are plenty of seasons to believe in Neighbours - - his playmaking ability, especially off the board, a decent motor and solid defensive fundamentaIs, and being sturdier than refrigerator. When opposition defenders step up on him, then crumble to the ice. He's a brick wall. Anda brick wall who can set-up teammates with some pace and deception have value. However, the list of concerns is lengthy and likely insurmountable. Neighbours' skating hasn't improved much; he remains heavily stride-dependent, lacking speed despite power generation, and a heel kick. Neighbours' reliance on straight-line skating leads to poor rush patterns, consistently limited to the perimeter without even attempting to prod the middle. While his passing skills project as above-average, he drops his head while powering through the neutral zone, preventing him from identifying teammates. As defenders close in, he tries to outrace them which often fails, resulting in mindless dump-ins and turnovers. While Neighbours' shot is a legitimate weapon, he is unable to make full use of it. Again, his perimeter-based rushes prevent him from penetrating the inside to fire. He fails to identify inside opportunities pre-shot, preferring to take a low-percentage shot when a quick cut toward the slot will improve his shot quality significantly. His awareness off-puck is highly limited, failing to identify pockets of space, even failing to make basic supporting playing in transition. Then, there's Neighbours' decision-making. He'll force a pass when a shot is the best play one shift, then do the opposite the next. Bad penalties, blown defensive zone coverage, and randomly giving up on plays are common sights. At best, he's erratic and a tad undisciplined. At worst, he's a detriment to his linemates. It's possible for Neighbours to overcome these issues; however, that would require a significant and unexpected leap in development. Even then, the fabric of his game probably won't change. Ultimately, the decision came down to one simple idea: If he makes moderate improvement like most prospects, he probably won't be a valuable NHL player, at least not by our standards. A unique, entertaining one? Perhaps. But he's more likely to sink a line than drive one; more likely end up doing so on the fourth line than the second one. "
Pavel Novak,"Pavel Novak stepped into a disjointed Kelowna Rockets team and made an immediate impact. He finished eighth among WHL first-time draft-eligible skaters in point per game output and fourth in primary points per game. There's no doubt that Novak is a capable WHL scorer with the potential to be among the league- leaders in points. He's a deceptive power play threat with angle-changing shots and look-off passes. While he's not much of a shooter at 5-on-5, he hits teammates in scoring areas with a wide array of creative passes. The issues are a dependency on space to create and a lack of tools to find or create that space. Novak's lack of separation tools starts with his skating. His quickness is hindered by a lack of ankle flexibility and hip mobility, preventing him from loading his stride properly. A wide stride recovery causes him to land exclusively on his inside edges, meaning he has no glide time in his strides and his pushes are shorter than necessary - in a word, inefficient. The lack of depth prevents Novak from achieving knee-over-knee crossover extension, while his overactive upper body, especially during his acceleration pattern, needlessly expends energy. As a result of Novak's lack of depth, he bends sharply at the hip, making him easy to push off of the puck and dispossess. He's also quite weak and doesn't apply himself to the degree necessary to win on the second effort, compounding his skating concerns. His defensive awareness is limited, and he doesn't engage physically or involve himself in the defensive zone by closing space and deterring passes. A lack of separation tools can be overcome by an ability to make plays while pressured. which Novak doesn't have. He relies on space to create - the very thing that his lack of separation tools will prevent him from getting at the next level. In transition, straight-line, low-pace attacks glue him to the perimeter and invite pressure. When pressure arrives, he's easily forced into poor decisions from a lack of problem-solving skills. He doesn't create by manipulation/moving defenders to open up his desired lane. Instead, he tries to beat them with perfect pass placement. While it earned points in the WHL, it came at the cost of heaps of needless turnovers. There's no avenue - at least, in our eyes - for Novak to have success at the next level. He's puck dominant, but highly inefficient - and the rest of his game isn't close to NHL-calibre. Novak relies on space that he won't get the at the next level to create because of a deeply flawed stride, lack of strength, and lack of standout skill, and he doesn't have the tools to play in-tight. "
Shakir Mukhamadullin,"Some team is going to draft Salavat Yulaev Ufa defenceman Shakir Mukhamadullin in the first two rounds of this year's draft. Book it. It's easy enough to understand why some teams covet the gangly Russian defender, too. There is always going to be a market for 6-foot-4 defenceman who can skate well, and Mukhamadullin certainly qualifies. He's worn a letter for Russia internationally, and always played on their top pairing last season. Hell, even the quantifiable stuff seems pretty nice. Mukhamadullin played almost the entire season with Salavat Yulaev Ufa's KHL squad, suiting up for 27 games and contributing a single assist. The pGPS (prospect Graduation Probabilities System) system that Jeremy Davis developed tags with an 84 percent chance of making the show; it's the seventh-highest figure in this class. When we watched Mukhamadullin play for Russia at the World Junior A Challenge, one could've easily convinced us this was his first year playing hockey. It was, without even a moment's hesitation, the worst hockey we've seen a commonly rated - - and rated highly at that - - skater play over the course of this scouting season. ""This performance belongs in the Hockey Hall of Fame -- in the all-time worst single-game performances of all time,"" Mitch Brown wrote in a game report from that tournament. ""Mukhamadullin opened the game with an impressive retrieval at speed, but then gave the puck away."" He continued, ""there were no fewer than seven giveaways during the breakout - - and many of them were unpressured. The sheer variety of turnovers was mindblowing: failed passes, failed rims, failed reversals, failed carries, and failed dump-outs. Defence was somehow even worse than transition. Not only did Mukhamadullin lose his man around the net several times, he gave virtually no effort defending off the rush."" ""It's one game,"" Brown cautioned, ""but this might be the worst single-game performance I've ever seen in person."" J.D. Burke, meanwhile. kept his assessment of his game short but to the point, ""good luck to whichever team drafts Shakir Mukhamadullin."" It's just one performance, but the issues that plagued Mukhamadullin against Junior A competition in this tournament were a consistent theme throughout the course of his season at every level. His penchant for unforced turnovers is unlike anyone else in this class. It almost defies logic that a player with so little creativity in-transition could lose control of the puck so regularly. The usual perks of a glass-and-out defenceman is that they don't turn the puck over in the worst possible spots. That is very much so not the case with Mukhamadullin. The one distinct weapon at Mukhamadullin's disposal is his shot. Mukhamadullin has a cannon for a one-timer, and he's not shy about using it. If he could learn to play better off the puck offence and put himself in better positions to wield that shot - - there might be something there. As currently constructed, though, it's hard to imagine a scenario where he's playing NHL hockey. Mukhamadullin doesn't defend, can't breakout the puck to save his life, and doesn't offer any value in transition. We really, really struggle to understand what the rest of the industry sees in this player. "
Trevor Kuntar,"Youngstown Phantoms forward Trevor Kuntar, a top-ten scorer in the USHL last season, wields a shot so heavy that he can beat goaltenders clean from just about anywhere in the offensive zone. Checking in at 6-feet-even, 203 pounds, Kuntar's stocky frame allows him to hang in there on puck battles and leverage himself against the opposition when digging for loose pucks. It doesn't hurt when he's battling for position in the net-front either, where his eye-hand coordination makes him a constant threat for deflection goals. If that's not enough, Kuntar offers positional versatility; he played both centre and wing for the Phantoms last season. He was also a fixture on Youngstown's first unit power play, primarily playing the net-front role. When his team is in the offensive zone, Kuntar sometimes scans for the quiet areas of ice, where scoring chances are generated, and tries to avail himself of those positions. When play is transitioning in the opposite direction, he's back-checking hard, and is vocal throughout, helping his team set up for the oncoming attackers. Now for the bad. Let's start with Kuntar's skating. It leaves a lot to be desired. He's not especially fast, nor is he especially agile, and he isn't all that strong on his skates for someone his size. He also deploys the mohawk skating stance to an alarming degree - - often as a substitute for a tight turn - - and that exposes the puck to the opposition far too often, far too easily. It also opens himself up to devastating hits that he shouldn't have to suffer. Likewise, Kuntar's straightaway stride is every bit as ugly. He's far too upright in his posture, and he recovers his stride well outside of his base. His speed is thusly limited in puck races and other Point A-to-Point B situations. While Kuntar is far from an elite decision-maker, this part of his game barely passes muster, so long as he has the space necessary to operate and survey his options. He's not an especially quick thinker with the puck, and doesn't play with a ton of pace as a result. He doesn't have the puck-handling ability to problem-solve in small-ice, and often finds himself easily pressured into turnovers or giveaways. And while we'd go so far as to rate Kuntar's shot as a distinct positive within his game, even that component is fairly flawed. Kuntar's shot selection is one area where there is ample room for improvement - - he just shoots from anywhere and everywhere, with little regard for what's happening around him. Taken as a whole, Kuntar's game and skill set will need a lot of refinement if he is to crack the pros. He is off to Boston College this season where he'll have the chance to play with the likes of Alex Newhook and Matthew Baldy. "
Tyler Kleven,"United States National Team Development Program U18 defender Tyler Kleven's been a big-time industry riser this season, but we at EliteProspects remain unconvinced. Before delving into the concerns, let's talk about the upside. Kleven's tall and not completely immobile. His stride clearly suffers from a lack of lower-body strength, depth, and an overactive upper-body. He's a strong single-variable defender, like stopping a 1-on-1rush, eliminating a player along the boards, and guiding the puck carrier up the boards. The defensive issues arise in more complex defensive situations, like small-area 2-on-1s, hand-offs along the boards, and establishing his gap after a turnover. He deviates from the fundamentals in these situations, turning away from the middle, failing to communicate with his partner, and isolating himself on one player leaving his partner to deal with the others. He's a sturdy neutral zone defender at his current level, but might struggle as he moves up the ranks because he consistently misreads the speed of the incoming attack and overestimates his own ability to pivot. He tends to establish his gap too late as well, only redeeming himself with his condor-like reach. In transition, Kleven has some flashes. When he limits his possession to himself, he's able to find teammates moving up the middle. However, he will over-handle the puck - strange because he struggles to receive passes on both the forehand and backhand. He refuses to find a second option if his first one is taken away, opting to simply change the speed of the pass instead. Many of his passes are too slow and too telegraphed to ever make their target in the USHL - let alone the NHL. And sometimes, he just gives up on trying to find a play, instead offloading his problems to his teammates. Apparently, Kleven's the proud owner of a booming one-timer, but the Saylyugem bear has more confirmed sightings. He's rarely ready to shoot, but occasionally hits a teammate with a crafty shot-pass or activates down low. But that's about it. All-in-all, there's just not enough draft-able elements in Kleven's game. Perhaps his skill set - tall, mobile, and flashes of competency - are worthy gamble. But competency isn't enough; even if he makes, we feel there's little chance he becomes a valuable NHL player. However. he's headed to North Dakota, a program with a history of turning rangy defenders into players. "
Will Cuylle,"Windsor Spitfires winger Will Cuylle is one of the most naturally gifted one-touch scorers in this year's draft. Put the puck on his stick, and he'll do the rest. Cuylle is a technically gifted shooter. He's got so much upper-body strength on that 6-foot- 2. 201- pound frame of his, and he puts it to good use generating quick-release wrist shots explode off his stick's blade. This, of course, begs the question: How did Cuylle score only 22 goals in his draft-year, four shot of the mark he set as a career-high in the OHL as a draft-minus-one skater? This is where we gesture aggressively towards literally every other component of Cuylle's game. Let's start with the most concerning element of all - - Cuylle's lack of scoring instincts. It's one thing to have a blistering wrist shot. but it's another entirely to put one's self in the position to wield it effectively. They just don't come much more stationary than Cuylle in the offensive zone. When he's not pursuing the puck on a dump-and-chase play, he's just not moving at alI. His off of the puck skating patterns aren't necessarily bad but that's only insofar as they don't exist at all to critique. This, combined with a poor sense of timing. and the inability to recognize space, often leave Cuylle on the outside looking in on rapidly developing plays in the offensive zone. If he can't keep up with the pace of OHL hockey. then it's hard to imagine a scenario where he suddenly develops the processing tools to play professional hockey. That's the thing about hockey sense - - you have it or you don't. It's not really a tool that one can develop or hone with time. So therein lies the problem. Cuylle is basically a one-tool scorer, and he can't create the space necessary to use it to its utmost potential at even the OHL level. Furthermore, Cuylle's skating isn't really at the level necessary to be a contributing player in those two zones. He's a bit upright in his posture, expends a lot of wasted upwards momentum through an out-toe on his extension, which only allows for the back-half of his blades to generate power. It's ugly. Some team is going to draft Will Cuylle, probably in the first three rounds at that. The combination of his size and an almost NHL-calibre shot are going to prove too much to pass up on for someone out there. If the NHL were a series of contests determined by the hardest or most accurate shot in strictly static situations, one might be able to justify as much, too. But it's not, and that's why we had to leave Cuylle off the board. "
William Villeneuve,"The tail end of our draft board hosts players with very flawed skill-sets. Yet, we didn't use one of those spots on Saint John Sea Dogs defenceman William Villeneuve - - the top-scoring defenceman in the QMJHL is nowhere to be found on our list. Scouts have often been proven wrong when they ignored high production in favour of a strict on-ice evaluation of the player. The numbers told them something that they didn't want to hear - - and there's a world in which that could happen to us, too. But this is where advanced metrics prove useful. Mitch Brown's statistical profile for Villeneuve, that goes beyond counting assists and goals, aligns nicely with our game reports. There are too many elements that have to go right or drastically improve for Villeneuve to make the NHL. He handles the puck and skates at a projectable below-average NHL level. He compensates for a lack of knee-bend by inefficiently folding at the hips; his arms swing in an almost wild manner, and his skates recover wide of his center of mass after every push. His noisy, uncontrolled stride causes jittery movements in his blade -- which makes it seem like the puck always wants to escape it - - and reduces his speed, acceleration, and agility, which limits his ability to distance opponents and match their movements. Some players still thrive in the NHL with below-average tools, but unlike them, Villeneuve doesn't play within his skill limitations; his habits or decision making don't elevate his inefficient foot-work and handling, but exposes them. Offensively, he misses passing options and defaults to uncontrolled plays, rimming the puck to covered teammates, or plants his feet, with his stick in the air, looking to shoot with no lane to do so in front of him. And defensively, he can't correct himself when he sets improper gaps or misses assignments - - which happens quite often. Unlike other long-shot players situated at the end of our board, we don't see in Villeneuve the one, clear NHL characteristic that could at least align his development arc towards a career in the top league. "
Garin Bjorklund,"You could ask a group of 20 goaltending coaches across the globe for a general consensus on Medicine Hat Tigers goaltender Garin Bjorklund, but good luck trying to wade through what they'd tell you. Evaluators either think that Bjorklund is another impressive, agile young goaltender flying through Medicine Hat, or they think he's riding on the high of Mads S0gaard, and will perennially frustrate the team that drafts him. There's not a whole lot of in between, and that's going to make for some fascinating draft boards when it comes to his placement. He's certainly entertaining, and his 'big-event' saves - - much like S0gaard ahead of him - - are hard to forget. For teams who want to draft a goaltender that they know already has the physical toolkit to make the most improbable saves, he's likely high on their list. But other areas of his game still need significant work, and even though most NHL clubs have elite development staffers, it's hard to justify him over some of the other goaltenders who are already a few steps ahead at this point in the game. One of the biggest keys to success in junior hockey, especiaIly as a goaltender, is confidence - - Bjorklund has it in spades. He's not afraid to make a snazzy glove save or toss in a pad stack just to spice things up, especially when he's already needing to make extra movements to get to where he needs to be. He's got the agility and he's got the toolkit, which is nice; he hasn't been over-coached, eliminating some of the more fun elements of the game. As much as a technically sound goaltender can seem like the safe bet, it's always kind of fun to see a goaltender who stilI seems to enjoy mixing it up in the middle of a game; he still looks like he's having a blast playing, and that's something that too often gets overlooked when evaluating young players. Obviously no one wants to coach the fun out of Bjorklund's game, but on the more routine plays it's easy to see where the technical wheels start to fall off a bit. He needs to work on his read of plays,in particular; it's hard to tell just how much of his choppier movements are lack of technical transitional development and how much is him struggling to stay ahead of the play withhis reads and tracking. He arrives at shots after they've been released from player's sticksa little too often, evenon more routine cycle plays and passing sequences, and he seems to get more caught up in puck-watching than anticipating players with body movement reads and release analysis. That's all stuff that can still be improved with developmental work, but it's worth pointing out that there are other goaltenders his age who have already started to master that element of their games. He'll need to step up in that respect if he's going to thrive higher than the minor league level. "
Drew Commesso,"United States National Team Development Program U18 goaltender Drew Commesso has fallen victim to ""Not Being Spencer Knight"" syndrome for many analysts, but he came into his own quite nicely once Knight moved on to college this past year. He posted some of the best numbers we've seen in the USNTDP in a while, making a big jump statistically and coming into his own in a way that made it clear he's got plenty to offer in his own right. Commesso plays a more aggressive game inherently, but he does a great job of staying on top of plays and reading through traffic. He rarely gets caught stutter-stepping his way across the crease trying to keep up with what's going on, even when plays break down in front of him and his sightlines get compromised. Perhaps my favourite part of his game is his situational awareness. He moves around with confidence, owning every inch of space within the crease with the kind of confidence that comes from both having a deep understanding of his own movements and from truly appreciating the finer points of what's going on around him. He moves out and back within his crease smoothly, skating at a higher level than a number of his fellow draft-eligibles this year and displaying crisper movements than he did in seasons past. He doesn't necessarily make every save look easy, but he does make his technique look consistent; it's comforting knowing that regardless of what happens in front of him, he's still going to play things the same way. His toolkit could be a little bit wider, but what he does have in his arsenal has been developed well. He plays like a goaltender who likes to perfect what he's learning before he debuts it in a game, and it serves him well - - especially at the level he's currently competing at. It will be interesting to see how that goes in his first collegiate season, but all of his development has pointed to him being a goaltender who's easy to coach and easy to track in his upwards trajectory. One of the biggest strengths that Knight displayed first with the NTDP and then with Boston College was his depth management and decision-making. He played a slightly more conservative game (when he wasn't getting fancy playing the puck), but was capable of getting more aggressive when he needed to without seeming out of his comfort zone. Commesso. on the other hand, plays a little bit more out than Knight did, but doesn't seem quite as comfortable moving back into the blue paint as his predecessor did coming out to play his style. It's a slight lack of versatility that might come with confidence and maturity, but still showed up as a bit of a red flag as I was watching some of his games. That more aggressive style also led to some overcommitment at times. which made Commesso more of a 'highlight-reel' goaltender than some scouts are comfortable with. He's clearly got the agility and the reaction speed, but those desperation saves always lead to a few questions about how welI he's able to anticipate certain plays - - even if he does do a fairly good job of reading others. "
Nick Malik,"I've heard rumblings that Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds goaltender Nick Malik might not get drafted, which is a peculiar prospect to consider. He's not getting the same kind of hype that fellow countryman Jan Bednar is, but his game has the kind of control and movement that teams should love to see -- and if he gets overlooked, it may be to some teams' benefit down the line when he's signed as a free agent. Malik, the son of former NHLer Marek Malik, the Czech-born goaltender made his way over to North America this year with the Soo Greyhounds of the OHL after spending the first half of the year in his home country. And while he had some growing pains, it's clear that he's still got more than enough talent to consider him a quality prospect. When it comes to all the little technical areas that a goaltender can work on, Malik has very little to worry about. His skating and his speed are above average, both in the Czech Republic and in North America, and he's got active hands that he isn't afraid to use Despite having a great level of athleticism, though, I thought that my viewings of Malik in Europe made him look calmer than many of his contemporaries - - something that was confirmed for me with a second opinion. His reads in the game keep him on top of the play, something that gives him an opportunity to choose how he plans to play each shot instead of forcing him to react out of desperation. He also draws plenty of praise for his ability to play the puck - - something that not every goaltender utilizes to its fullest, but is a nice addition to any skill set. Given his speed with skating and his puck-handling abilities, he could be an exciting prospect to bring on board for a team that wants to see versatility in all areas. I thought Malik looked in control in highlights and snippets caught over in the Czech Republic, but his game took a little bit of time to settle down when he got to North America. At times, he found himself having to correct for movement, and an OHL goaltending coach went on record as saying that he still needs some work on his decision-making when it comes to his game on this side of the pond. Of course, there's stilI a fairly small sample size with that, though, so it's tough to really get a read on just how well he'll be able to develop that part of his game on a smaller ice surface; he didn't make it over to North America until January, and the OHL season was cancelled in March due to covid-19 concerns. He's back over in the Czech Republic right now, where seasons are already about to get under way while North America is going to take longer thanks to the pandemic, so we'II have to wait to see how that development continues. "
Amir Miftakhov,"It's the last year that Amir Miftakhov of Kazan, Russia is eligible for the draft - - and while he's been highly touted by a handful of scouts and evaluators alike for the last few years now, it's becoming harder and harder to see a scenario where he gets chosen this fall. Miftakhov is smart, crafty, and boasts plenty of speed; he's been playing a well-managed and agile game for the last three years, and took additional leaps and bounds this season as he made his first forays into the Ak-Bars Kazan KHL lineup. He doesn't leave himself vulnerable often, and seems to have spent every year that teams pass over him in the draft getting more confident with his own style of play; while it's not a given that he'll actually get selected, it's sure fun to watch his game tape and wonder if he won't end up being a smart signing for an NHL club somewhere down the line in any instance. Although he's not the tallest player you'll find, Miftakhov utilizes his size well by blending a well-positioned game with plenty of speed. He doesn't mind coming out to challenge shots, but also boasts controlled lateral movement and quick hands that make it hard to take a look at the net and see obvious holes left for even the craftiest of shooters. His skating stands out among the draft class, as does his decision-making - - and although it's important to remember that he's nearly two years older than some of the other goaltenders he's up against, those have been attributes that make his game fun to watch since he was first draft-eligible in 2018. It's always fun to watch and see how goaltenders handle those draft-eligible seasons, and Miftakhov has managed to keep plowing forward as he's moved from being a star in the MHL to a front-runner in the VHL en route to an eventual starting gig in the KHL. He's spent years moving up through the quality of competition in Russia, and he handles the improved skill level of shooters each year with calculated poise: while his technique has always been fairly good, it's his hockey sense that really continues to make him stand out. Listed at just 6-feet-even and only 165 pounds, Miftakhov is undeniably one of the smaller-statured goaltenders in the draft class. Not only is he a little on the short side, but he's got a fairly slight build as well - - and that's presuming that his stats are listed accurately. Even some of the NHL's smallest goaltenders, like Antti Raanta and Jaroslav Halak, have a good 20 pounds on the Russian-born prospect -- and in his final year of draft eligibility, it's less likely that he's still waiting on a growth spurt that will help him bulk up. He does a good job of managing his depth for his size, but the wider and lower stance that he favours would open up some holes up top and leave him vulnerable. "
Tucker Tynan,"Perhaps the toughest goaltender to grade for this year's draft is Niagara lceDogs netminder Tucker Tynan. When I looked at the 2020 draft-eligible goaltenders back in the late fall of 2019, I had him on my list as a guy to watch - - not just because he was putting up good numbers for the Niagara lce Dogs, but because he had made such a nice transition from being a late-round OHL draftee to being a reliable starter. Nothing about his game at the time particularly wowed me, but I thought he was playing effectively and had a lot of promise that I wanted to see develop over the course of the 2019-20 season. Then, not long after I mused that I'd wanted to see just how far he could go, he was cut by a skate blade during a game and underwent major surgery. He's been in recovery for a severed artery and major blood loss since last December, leaving scouts - - and NHL teams - - unsure of just what to do about him in terms of their drafting. Assuming Tynan is able to make a full recovery in all areas of his play, he's got plenty of promise as a late round draft pick. It seems hard to imagine that a team would be wasting resources by picking him up; he had great movement, agility, and was taking leaps and bounds in his development at the time of his injury. But a severed artery is a major ordeal to overcome, and there's no guarantee that his game will ever be exactly what it was. Additionally. there's a psychological element to consider. Tynan's injury came when another skater's blade severely lacerated his leg, something that was entirely unintentional but also hard to prepare for. He'll have to specifically work on his reaction time and his response when plays are chaotic and dirty right in and around his crease, because that could be a problem area for a little bit - - and although it's hard to see him not making an eventual full recovery, it's worth considering just how long it could take him to get back to where he was. Making the Jump from the NCDC to the OHL was done effectively and seamlessly by Tynan, so he's still an incredibly promising option. But he was still a little below where we'd want to see a highly-ranked goaltending prospect on crispness, accuracy, and control. And we unfortunately didn't get the opportunity to see him grow and tweak those areas over the course of the remainder of the season. "
